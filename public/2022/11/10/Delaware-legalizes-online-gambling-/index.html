    <section>
      <h1 id="Delaware-legalizes-online-gambling"><a href="#Delaware-legalizes-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Delaware legalizes online gambling"></a>Delaware legalizes online gambling</h1><p>The state of Delaware has legalized online gambling, becoming the first state in the US to do so. This is a major development in the world of online gambling, as it could pave the way for other states to follow suit.</p>
<p>Delaware’s new law allows people aged 21 and over to gamble online, including casino games, poker and sports betting. Players will be able to place bets through the websites of Delaware’s three licensed casinos: Delaware Park, Dover Downs and Harrington Raceway.</p>
<p>The passage of this law is seen as a major victory for the gambling industry, as it opens up a new market for online casinos and gaming providers. It is also expected to create jobs and generate revenue for the state of Delaware.</p>
<p>The legalization of online gambling in Delaware could have implications for other states in the US, as it could provide a blueprint for how they can legalize and regulate the industry. There is growing momentum behind legalizing online gambling, as more people are turning to the internet to gamble.</p>
<p>The legalization of online gambling in Delaware is good news for players too, as they now have access to a range of top-quality casino games and betting options. Players can enjoy all their favorite casino games from the comfort of their own home, with no need to travel to a physical casino.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-legalizes-online-gambling"><a href="#Nevada-legalizes-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Nevada legalizes online gambling"></a>Nevada legalizes online gambling</h1><p>The Nevada State Assembly has voted in favor of a bill that would legalize online gambling within the state. The measure now goes to the Senate for approval.</p>
<p>Senator Mark Lipparelli, sponsor of the bill, believes that legalizing online gambling will provide a much-needed boost to the state’s economy. “This is a jobs bill,” he said.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill argue that it will lead to increased gambling addiction and social problems. But Lipparelli dismissed those concerns, saying that “the current law is not preventing people from gambling online.”</p>
<p>Under the proposed bill, internet poker would be legalized and regulated by the Nevada Gaming Commission. Players would have to be at least 21 years old and located within Nevada’s borders in order to participate.</p>
<p>If approved by the Senate, the measure would go into effect on January 1, 2013.</p>
<h1 id="New-Jersey-legalizes-online-gambling"><a href="#New-Jersey-legalizes-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey legalizes online gambling"></a>New Jersey legalizes online gambling</h1><p>On October 6, 2017, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie signed into law a bill that legalized online gambling in the state. The new law allows licensed casinos in New Jersey to offer online poker, casino games, and slots to players located within the state boundaries.</p>
<p>Governor Christie hailed the move as a major victory for the state’s $24 billion gaming industry. He noted that the bill would create “hundreds of new jobs” and generate millions of dollars in tax revenue for the state.</p>
<p>Opponents of online gambling argue that it is addictive and can lead to compulsive gambling behavior. They also express concern that it can be used by criminal organizations to launder money.</p>
<p>Supporters of online gambling argue that it is a safe and convenient way to gamble, and that it can be monitored to ensure player safety. They also point out that online gambling is already popular in other countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia, and that it has generated billions of dollars in revenue for those jurisdictions.</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania-legalizes-online-gambling"><a href="#Pennsylvania-legalizes-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania legalizes online gambling"></a>Pennsylvania legalizes online gambling</h1><p>On October 10, 2017, Pennsylvania state legislators passed a bill that legalized online gambling within the state. Governor Tom Wolf has expressed his intent to sign the bill into law, making Pennsylvania the fourth US state to offer online gambling after Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware.</p>
<p>The new law will regulate and tax both casino games and poker played over the internet. Operators must be licensed by the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board and pay a licensing fee of $10 million. The state will take a 34% tax from gross gaming revenue, with part of that money earmarked for property tax reduction and horse racing industry support.</p>
<p>Online casinos and poker rooms must meet certain requirements in order to qualify for a license. They must be physically located within Pennsylvania, offer games that are already legal in the state’s land-based casinos, and have robust anti-gambling measures in place.</p>
<p>One goal of the new law is to combat illegal offshore gambling operations. The legislation requires operators to use geolocation technology to ensure that players are physically located within Pennsylvania. Players will also be required to create an account with their true name and social security number in order to play. This should help to preventPennsylvanians from gambling on unlicensed sites operated by shady offshore operators.</p>
<p>While there are some restrictions on which games can be played online (no slot machines), most of the popular casino games will be available for play on desktop or mobile devices. Players will also have access to a wide range of betting options on sports events, including both pre-match and in-play betting.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania’s new online gambling law is good news for residents and visitors alike. It will provide more options for people who want to gamble legally, while also generating much-needed revenue for the state government.</p>
<h1 id="Rhode-Island-legalizes-online-gambling"><a href="#Rhode-Island-legalizes-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Rhode Island legalizes online gambling"></a>Rhode Island legalizes online gambling</h1><p>The state of Rhode Island has legalized online gambling, becoming the fourth state in the US to do so. The law took effect on July 1, 2019.</p>
<p>Under the new law, residents of Rhode Island will be able to gamble online through the state’s lottery system. They will also be able to bet on sports and play casino games online.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction counselors are concerned that the new law could lead to an increase in gambling addiction problems. However, supporters of the law argue that it will provide additional revenue for the state government and create jobs.</p>
