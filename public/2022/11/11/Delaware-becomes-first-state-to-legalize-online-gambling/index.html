      <h1 id="Delaware-becomes-first-state-to-legalize-online-gambling"><a href="#Delaware-becomes-first-state-to-legalize-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Delaware becomes first state to legalize online gambling"></a>Delaware becomes first state to legalize online gambling</h1><p>The state of Delaware has become the first in the US to legalize online gambling, with Governor Jack Markell signing the bill into law on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Online poker and casino games will be available to players in Delaware from October, with the state expecting to generate around $7 million in annual revenue from licensing fees.</p>
<p>“This is about economic development,” said Governor Markell. “It’s about creating jobs and bringing new money into our state.”</p>
<p>The move is seen as a significant step forward for the online gambling industry, with other states likely to follow Delaware’s lead. Nevada and New Jersey have also legalized online gambling, but have yet to launch any commercial operations.</p>
<p>Delaware’s new law allows casinos to partner with internet gaming providers, who will be responsible for handling customer registrations, payments and security. Players must be physically located within Delaware in order to gamble online.</p>
<p>Opponents of online gambling argue that it can be addictive and lead to financial problems, but supporters say that it is a safe and secure way to enjoy casino games from the comfort of your own home.</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania-legalizes-online-gambling"><a href="#Pennsylvania-legalizes-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania legalizes online gambling"></a>Pennsylvania legalizes online gambling</h1><p>On October 26, 2017, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf signed into law a bill legalizing online gambling in the state. The move marks a watershed moment for the gaming industry in the United States, as Pennsylvania is now the fourth state to legalize online gambling, after New Jersey, Nevada, and Delaware.</p>
<p>The new law allows for both casino-style games and poker to be played online in Pennsylvania, with licenses starting at $10 million per operator. It is expected that the first wave of legalized online gambling will go live in Pennsylvania in early 2018.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of legalizing online gambling is that it is expected to generate significant tax revenue for the state. According to estimates from the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB), the new law could bring in as much as $200 million annually in tax revenue. This would be a major boon for Pennsylvania, which is currently facing a budget crisis.</p>
<p>Online gambling has been growing rapidly in popularity in recent years. In 2016, casino gaming revenue in the United States was estimated at $24.7 billion, with over half of that ($13.2 billion) generated from online and mobile gaming sources. It is clear that there is a large and growing market for online gambling, and states are increasingly looking to tap into this market by legalizing it.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons why states are moving to legalize online gambling. One major reason is that it can provide a significant source of revenue for states. As mentioned earlier, Pennsylvania expects to bring in $200 million annually in tax revenue from online gambling. Other states have also seen positive results from legalizing online gambling. For example, New Jersey generated over $180 million in tax revenue from online gambling in 2016 alone.</p>
<p>Another reason states are legalizing online gambling is because it can help support their local economy and create jobs. For example, operators who receive licenses to offer online gambling in Pennsylvania will be required to have their servers located within the state. This will create jobs and boost the economy in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Legalizing online gambling can also help combat illegal betting operations. By legalizing and regulating online gambling, states can ensure that players are playing on safe and fair websites and that all taxes and revenues are properly collected. This helps protect consumers and ensures that governments receive any benefits that may come from legalized gambling operations.</p>
<p>While there are many benefits to legalizing online gambling, there are also some potential downsides to consider. One concern is that legalization could lead to an increase in problem or addicted gamblers. However, research on this topic has been mixed, with some studies indicating that legalization does lead to an increase in problem gamblers while others indicating no significant change or even a decrease in problem gamblers rates following legalization.</p>
<p>Another concern is that legalized online gambling could hurt brick-and-mortar casinos located within a state. This could happen if people shift their spending away from physical casinos towards legalized online casinos. However, at this point it is unclear how much impact legalized online casinos will have on physical casinos – this remains an area of ongoing research .</p>
<h1 id="New-York-legalizes-online-gambling"><a href="#New-York-legalizes-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="New York legalizes online gambling"></a>New York legalizes online gambling</h1><p>In a landmark decision on Monday, the New York State Gaming Commission voted unanimously to legalize online gambling. This decision opens up a new frontier in the gaming industry and is expected to generate millions of dollars in revenue for the state government.</p>
<p>As part of the new regulations, residents of New York will be able to gamble on websites operated by the state’s nine commercial casinos. These sites will offer a variety of games, including blackjack, roulette, and poker.</p>
<p>Online gambling has been illegal in New York since 2006, when then-Governor George Pataki signed a bill into law that banned the activity. However, this new ruling provides for a more liberal regulatory framework that is designed to protect consumers and ensure that casinos are not exploited by offshore operators.</p>
<p>Commission chairman James Featherstonhaugh said that the decision was based on “the belief that we can provide a safe and secure experience for New Yorkers who want to wager online.” He added that the commission would “closely monitor” the industry to make sure that players are treated fairly and that there is no “corruption or other criminal behavior.”</p>
<p>Supporters of online gambling say that it will generate much-needed revenue for the state government at a time when tax revenues are declining. They also argue that it will create jobs and stimulate economic growth.</p>
<p>Opponents of online gambling say that it is addictive and can lead to financial ruin for vulnerable individuals. They also contend that it is difficult to regulate, and that there is a risk of fraud and money laundering.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-legalizes-online-gambling"><a href="#Nevada-legalizes-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Nevada legalizes online gambling"></a>Nevada legalizes online gambling</h1><p>Nevada has become the first state to legalize online gambling, in a move that is expected to spark a flurry of similar legislation in other states. The new law allows Nevadans to place bets online or on their mobile phones, and will come into effect in early 2013.</p>
<p> Supporters of the new law say it will help to revive Nevada’s struggling casino industry, which has been hit hard by the economic downturn. They believe that online gambling will attract more players to Nevada’s casinos, and generate more revenue for the state.</p>
<p>Opponents of the new law argue that it could lead to addiction and gambling problems among Nevada residents. They also claim that it will be difficult to regulate and could be used by criminals to launder money.</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, the Nevada legislature passed the bill by a vote of 27-13, and Governor Brian Sandoval signed it into law on October 10, 2011.</p>
<h1 id="California-legalizes-online-gambling"><a href="#California-legalizes-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="California legalizes online gambling"></a>California legalizes online gambling</h1><p>On October 15, 2018, Californians voted in favor of legalizing online gambling. This makes California the fourth state in the US to legalize some form of internet gambling. The law will go into effect on January 1, 2019.</p>
<p>The new law allows residents 21 years or older to gamble on casino games, poker, and sports betting from their smartphones or computers. Online casinos must be licensed by the state and pay a 15 percent tax on gross gaming revenues.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill say it will generate much-needed revenue for the state budget and create jobs in the casino industry. Opponents argue that it will lead to more problem gambling and addiction.</p>
<p>So far, only three online casinos have obtained licenses from the state. They are Golden Nugget, Betfair US, and Pala Interactive. More are expected to apply in the coming months.</p>
