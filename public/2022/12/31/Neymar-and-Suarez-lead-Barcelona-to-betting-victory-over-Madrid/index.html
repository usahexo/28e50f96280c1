      <h1 id="Neymar-and-Suarez-lead-Barcelona-to-betting-victory-over-Madrid"><a href="#Neymar-and-Suarez-lead-Barcelona-to-betting-victory-over-Madrid" class="headerlink" title="Neymar and Suarez lead Barcelona to betting victory over Madrid"></a>Neymar and Suarez lead Barcelona to betting victory over Madrid</h1><p> Neymar and Suarez both scored as Barcelona beat Real Madrid 3-0 in the Spanish Super Cup first leg.</p>
<p>Neymar opened the scoring in the tenth minute, before Suarez doubled the lead just before half time. Neymar then completed the scoring in the second half to give Barca a huge advantage ahead of next Wednesday’s return leg at the Bernabeu.</p>
<p>Real Madrid had midfielder Mateo Kovacic sent off late on for a second bookable offence, but it was too little, too late for Los Blancos.</p>
<p>The result is a major blow to new Madrid manager Julen Lopetegui, who will be desperate to make amends in next week’s return leg.</p>
<h1 id="Messi-penalty-sends-Barcelona-top-of-the-betting-table"><a href="#Messi-penalty-sends-Barcelona-top-of-the-betting-table" class="headerlink" title="Messi penalty sends Barcelona top of the betting table"></a>Messi penalty sends Barcelona top of the betting table</h1><p>Lionel Messi scored a penalty in the seventh minute of added time against Alavés to send Barcelona top of the betting table. The Argentine’s late goal capped off an impressive comeback from the Catalan side, who were trailing 2-1 with just minutes left on the clock.</p>
<p>Messi’s penalty was his sixth goal in five La Liga appearances this season, and it ensured that Barcelona kept up their 100% start to the campaign. Manager Ernesto Valverde will be delighted with the resilience and character shown by his side on Sunday evening, and they will now look forward to Wednesday night’s Champions League clash against PSV Eindhoven.</p>
<p>Barca were missing a number of first-team regulars for the trip to Mendizorroza Stadium, including Luis Suárez, Jordi Alba and Ousmane Dembélé. But Antoine Griezmann stepped up to the plate with a goal and an assist on his league debut for the club.</p>
<p>It looked as though Barca were going to squander their chance to go top of the table, however, as they fell behind to two goals from Burgui in the first half. The Spaniard opened the scoring in the 17th minute before doubling his tally shortly before halftime.</p>
<p>But Griezmann pulled one back for Barca in the second half before Messi’s last-minute heroics sealed all three points for Valverde’s men. They are now one point clear of Atlético Madrid at the top of La Liga, although Los Colchoneros have a game in hand.</p>
<h1 id="Barcelona-makes-a-mockery-of-the-bookies-with-staggering-7-0-win"><a href="#Barcelona-makes-a-mockery-of-the-bookies-with-staggering-7-0-win" class="headerlink" title="Barcelona makes a mockery of the bookies with staggering 7-0 win"></a>Barcelona makes a mockery of the bookies with staggering 7-0 win</h1><p>Barcelona made the bookies look like fools on Sunday night as they absolutely demolished Eibar 7-0. The victory was a perfect response to their shock defeat to Leganes in their last game, and it put them right back in the title race.</p>
<p>Lionel Messi led the way with a hat-trick, while Luis Suarez and Philippe Coutinho also got on the scoresheet. It was a thoroughly dominant performance from start to finish, and it sent a message to their rivals that they are still very much contenders for the championship.</p>
<p>This was Barcelona’s biggest win of the season so far, and it is sure to give them a lot of confidence as they head into the business end of the campaign. They have now moved up to second place in the table, and they will be looking to keep the pressure on Real Madrid at the top.</p>
<p>Sunday’s result also means that Eibar have now conceded 27 goals in just 11 games this season. They are really struggling defensively, and it is likely that they will struggle to stay up if they don’t improve soon.</p>
<p>It has been an eventful few weeks for Barcelona, but things are starting to look much better for them now. Their Champions League campaign is going well, and with Lionel Messi in such good form, they can certainly challenge for La Liga too.</p>
<h1 id="Neymar-inspires-Barca-to-significant-betting-win-over-Atletico-Madrid"><a href="#Neymar-inspires-Barca-to-significant-betting-win-over-Atletico-Madrid" class="headerlink" title="Neymar inspires Barca to significant betting win over Atletico Madrid"></a>Neymar inspires Barca to significant betting win over Atletico Madrid</h1><p>Neymar inspired Barcelona to a significant victory over their title rivals Atletico Madrid in La Liga action on Saturday. The Brazilian forward was in fine form, scoring twice and setting up another as Barca ran out 4-0 winners at the Nou Camp.</p>
<p>The result sees Barca close the gap on Atletico at the top of the table to just two points, and they will be full of confidence as they head into next weekend’s El Clasico showdown with Real Madrid. Neymar is sure to be one of the key players for Luis Enrique’s side on that occasion, and he has once again shown that he is capable of producing moments of magic on the biggest stages.</p>
<p>Barca were given a scare in the early stages of Saturday’s clash, with Diego Godin coming close to opening the scoring for Atletico. But Neymar soon stamped his authority on proceedings, firing home a fine opener in the 22nd minute. He then doubled Barca’s advantage shortly after half-time with a well-taken strike, and he completed his hat-trick with a clinical finish late on.</p>
<p>The result could have been even worse for Atletico, but goalkeeper Jan Oblak made a number of excellent saves to keep them in the game. As it is, they now find themselves eight points adrift of Barcelona in third place, and they will need an improved performance if they are to get anything from next weekend’s clash at the Santiago Bernabeu.</p>
<h1 id="Suarez-double-sees-Barcelona-5-points-clear-at-the-top-of-the-betting"><a href="#Suarez-double-sees-Barcelona-5-points-clear-at-the-top-of-the-betting" class="headerlink" title="Suarez double sees Barcelona 5 points clear at the top of the betting"></a>Suarez double sees Barcelona 5 points clear at the top of the betting</h1><p>Odds-on favourites Barcelona cemented their position at the top of the La Liga betting with a comfortable 2-0 victory over Espanyol, with Luis Suarez netting both goals.</p>
<p>The result left them five points clear of second-placed Valencia and Diego Simeone’s Atletico Madrid, who suffered a surprise 2-1 home defeat to Girona.</p>
<p>Barca were in control for most of the game at the RCDE Stadium, but they had to wait until the 78th minute for Suarez to open the scoring.</p>
<p>The striker doubled his tally and his team’s lead three minutes from time, as he coolly netted from close range after Neymar had set him up.</p>
<p>Espanyol rarely threatened during the contest and they went down to 10 men late on when Sergio Garcia was sent off for a second bookable offence.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Real Madrid kept pace with their title rivals by coming from behind to beat Real Sociedad 3-1 thanks to two goals from Cristiano Ronaldo and one from Karim Benzema.</p>
<p>The result means that Los Blancos are now just two points adrift of Barca, who have a game in hand, while Atletico are four points off the pace.</p>
