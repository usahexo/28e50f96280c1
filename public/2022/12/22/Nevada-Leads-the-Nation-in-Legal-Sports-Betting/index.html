      <h1 id="Nevada-Leads-the-Nation-in-Legal-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Nevada-Leads-the-Nation-in-Legal-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Leads the Nation in Legal Sports Betting"></a>Nevada Leads the Nation in Legal Sports Betting</h1><p>In Nevada, sports betting is legal. And the industry is booming.</p>
<p>According to a report from the Nevada Gaming Commission, sports betting revenue reached a record high in 2018. In total, sports bets generated $3.9 billion in revenue last year. This was an increase of 16 percent from 2017.</p>
<p>And Nevada is not alone. Across the United States, sports betting is becoming increasingly popular. A study from Eilers &amp; Krejcik Gaming LLC found that Americans wagered $4.76 billion on state-regulated sports betting in 2018. This was a 33 percent increase from 2017.</p>
<p>So what is driving this growth?</p>
<p>A major factor is the Supreme Court’s decision last year to overturn the federal ban on Sports Betting. In May 2018, the Court ruled that the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) was unconstitutional. This allowed states to legalize and regulate sports betting within their borders.</p>
<p>Since then, several states have moved to legalize sports betting. As of March 2019, there were nine states with active sports betting markets: Delaware, Nevada, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Mississippi, Rhode Island, New Mexico and Arkansas. More states are expected to follow suit in the coming years.</p>
<p>The growth of legal sports betting has been good news for casinos and gambling companies. It has also been good news for fans of sports betting who now have more options than ever before when it comes to placing bets on their favorite teams.</p>
<h1 id="More-States-Join-the-Ranks-of-Legal-Sports-Betting"><a href="#More-States-Join-the-Ranks-of-Legal-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="More States Join the Ranks of Legal Sports Betting"></a>More States Join the Ranks of Legal Sports Betting</h1><p>After the repeal of the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) in May 2018, states have been quick to legalize sports betting within their borders.</p>
<p>As of September 2018, seven states have passed legislation to allow sports betting, and an additional five are in the process of doing so.</p>
<p>The trend is likely to continue, as more and more states see the potential revenue that legalized sports betting can bring in.</p>
<p>According to a study by Eilers &amp; Krejcik Gaming, LLC, total legal sports betting revenues could reach $7.22 billion by 2023.</p>
<p>This would represent a major increase over the $4.2 billion generated by black market wagers in 2017.</p>
<p>Legalized sports betting could also create new jobs in the gambling industry. For example, the Eilers &amp; Krejcik study estimated that nearly 21,000 new jobs could be created in New Jersey alone.</p>
<p>States that have legalized sports betting are already seeing the benefits. In Nevada, for example, gaming revenues from all types of games increased by 4.9% in July 2018 compared to July 2017. This was largely due to an increase in sports betting revenue of 33%.</p>
<p>It is clear that states which legalize sports betting will see significant increases in tax revenue as well. In Rhode Island, for example,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> tax revenue from casino gaming increased by 10% in July 2018 compared to July 2017. This was largely due to an increase in sports betting revenue of 231%.</p>
<p>Legalized sports betting is also likely to lead to an increase in tourism revenues. In Atlantic City, for example, there was a 5% increase in hotel room occupancy rates in July 2018 compared to July 2017. This was largely due to the opening of two new sportsbooks at casinos in Atlantic City.</p>
<p>As more and more states legalize sports betting, it is inevitable that interstate gambling disputes will arise. For example, what happens if a player located in one state places a bet on a game being played in another state? Will this bet be considered legal? These are questions that will need to be answered by the courts.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Sports-Betting-revenue-up-in-first-full-year-of-operation"><a href="#Delaware-Sports-Betting-revenue-up-in-first-full-year-of-operation" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Sports Betting revenue up in first full year of operation"></a>Delaware Sports Betting revenue up in first full year of operation</h1><p>According to figures from the Delaware Department of Finance, total sports betting revenue in the state was up 181 percent in the first full year of operation (2018), following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the federal ban on sports betting.</p>
<p>In 2018, Delaware took in $7.5 million in sports betting revenue, up from $2.7 million in 2017. The state had been taking wagers on NFL and college games since 2009, but ceased operations when the federal ban was implemented.</p>
<p>The growth in revenue was attributed to an increase in both the number of people placing bets and the size of bets. In 2018, nearly twice as many bets were placed than in 2017, with an average bet size that increased by 38 percent.</p>
<p>Delaware Governor John Carney said that he was pleased with the growth in sports betting revenue, but added that more work needs to be done to ensure that Delawareans “fully benefit” from legalized sports betting. Carney has pushed for a share of sports betting revenue to be directed towards education and tourism initiatives in the state.</p>
<p>While Delaware saw strong growth in its first full year of sports betting operation, other states have seen even larger increases. In New Jersey, which had been taking bets illegally for years before the Supreme Court’s decision, sports betting revenue totaled $254 million in 2018, up from just $9 million in 2017.</p>
<h1 id="Online-Sports-Betting-thrives-in-New-Jersey-despite-federal-ban"><a href="#Online-Sports-Betting-thrives-in-New-Jersey-despite-federal-ban" class="headerlink" title="Online Sports Betting thrives in New Jersey despite federal ban"></a>Online Sports Betting thrives in New Jersey despite federal ban</h1><p>On May 14, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a federal law that barred most states from authorizing sports betting, opening the door for states to legalize the industry.</p>
<p>Nine months after the court’s ruling, New Jersey became the second state to allow regulated sports betting. The industry has thrived in the Garden State and is expected to bring in over $1 billion in annual revenue by 2021.</p>
<p>The popularity of online sports betting has exploded in New Jersey, with over $460 million wagered through November. That’s more than four times what was bet in the state during the same period last year.</p>
<p>Much of that increase can be attributed to the ease and convenience of online wagering. Sports fans no longer have to leave their homes or find a local casino to place a bet; they can do it all from their smartphones or computers.</p>
<p>Online sports betting is also popular because it offers better odds than traditional casino gambling. For example, you might get paid 6-to-1 if you bet on a football game correctly, while you might only earn 3-to-2 at a blackjack table.</p>
<p>Fans of all major professional and college sports can place bets on games at any time of day or night. There are also countless prop bets available for those looking for something more exotic than just who will win or lose.</p>
<p>While online sports betting is now legal in New Jersey, it remains illegal in most other states. That could soon change, as more and more states move to legalize the industry in light of the Supreme Court’s ruling.</p>
<h1 id="Rhode-Island-takes-first-step-toward-legal-sports-betting"><a href="#Rhode-Island-takes-first-step-toward-legal-sports-betting" class="headerlink" title="Rhode Island takes first step toward legal sports betting"></a>Rhode Island takes first step toward legal sports betting</h1><p>Rhode Island lawmakers introduced a bill on Wednesday that would legalize sports betting in the state. The bill, introduced by Rep. Joseph McNamara and Sen. Michael McCaffrey, would allow individuals over the age of 21 to place bets on professional and amateur sporting events.</p>
<p>The bill is seen as a first step in establishing Rhode Island as a hub for legal sports betting, with the potential to bring in millions of dollars in revenue to the state each year.</p>
<p>“This legislation will provide a new stream of revenue for our state while also protecting consumers,” McNamara said in a statement. “It is time for Rhode Island to enter this rapidly growing industry and I am confident that this bill will pass both chambers.”</p>
<p>Rhode Island is one of several states considering legalizing sports betting in the wake of last year’s Supreme Court decision that struck down a federal ban on the activity. Delaware, New Jersey, West Virginia, and Mississippi have all moved forward with proposals to legalize sports betting, while Pennsylvania and Connecticut are also weighing similar measures.</p>
<p>If passed, Rhode Island would become the first state in New England to offer legal sports betting. Neighboring Massachusetts has been exploring the possibility of legalizing sports betting but has yet to take any action.</p>
