        <h1 id="Ecuador-bans-baccarat"><a href="#Ecuador-bans-baccarat" class="headerlink" title="Ecuador bans baccarat"></a>Ecuador bans baccarat</h1><p>In a surprise move, Ecuador’s government has announced that it is to ban the playing of baccarat in all its forms. The president of the republic, Lenín Moreno, made the announcement on Wednesday, saying that the game was a “dangerous addiction” which could lead to financial ruin.</p>
<p>“This is a preventative measure to protect our citizens from the dangers of this game,” Moreno said. “It can lead to bankruptcy and poverty, and we want to avoid that at all costs.”</p>
<p>The ban will come into effect on Thursday, and violators could face fines or imprisonment. Baccarat is popular in Ecuador, especially in the casinos of Quito and Guayaquil, and the news has been met with dismay by many players.</p>
<p>“This is a terrible decision,” said one player. “Baccarat is my favorite game and I’ve been playing it for years. I don’t see how they can just ban it like this.”</p>
<p>Others have welcomed the move, saying that it was long overdue. “This game is nothing but a temptation to lose money,” said one casino worker. “It’s good that they’re finally doing something about it.”</p>
<p>The government has not given any reason for its sudden decision to ban baccarat, but many experts believe that it may be linked to plans to introduce new gambling laws later this year.</p>
<h1 id="100-000-prize-available-in-Ecuadorian-baccarat-tournament"><a href="#100-000-prize-available-in-Ecuadorian-baccarat-tournament" class="headerlink" title="$100,000 prize available in Ecuadorian baccarat tournament"></a>$100,000 prize available in Ecuadorian baccarat tournament</h1><p>A baccarat tournament is being hosted in Ecuador with a $100,000 prize pool. The tournament will be held at the Wyndham Garden Hotel in Quito from October 12-14.</p>
<p>There are ten different levels of buy-ins, starting at $275 and going up to $10,000. Players who make it to the final table will compete for a piece of the prize pool.</p>
<p>Baccarat is a card game that has been around for centuries. It is considered a casino classic and is often played by high rollers. The game is simple to learn but can be difficult to master.</p>
<p>In baccarat, players bet on whether they think the player or the banker will have the higher score. There are also side bets available, such as whether the player will get a natural (an ace and a two through nine card).</p>
<p>The popularity of baccarat has surged in recent years, thanks in part to its inclusion in popular casino movies such as “Casino Royale” and “The Hangover”. The game can be enjoyed by players of all skill levels and is perfect for those looking for a high-stakes gambling experience.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in participating in the Ecuadorian baccarat tournament, head over to the Wyndham Garden Hotel website for more information.</p>
