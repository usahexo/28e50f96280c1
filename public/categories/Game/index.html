        <h1 id="Curacao-takes-home-30-million-from-Microgaming"><a href="#Curacao-takes-home-30-million-from-Microgaming" class="headerlink" title="Curacao takes home $30 million from Microgaming"></a>Curacao takes home $30 million from Microgaming</h1><p>The island of Curacao has been enjoying a surge in its economy lately, thanks in large part to a new agreement with the gaming software giant Microgaming. Under the new arrangement, the company will be using Curacao as its primary base for all of its operations in the Latin American market.</p>
<p>In return, Curacao will be taking in $30 million in annual licensing fees from Microgaming. This is great news for the island, which is still recovering from a devastating hurricane last year. The influx of cash is expected to help create hundreds of new jobs on the island and revive its tourism industry.</p>
<p>Speaking about the agreement, Curacao’s Minister for Economic Development, Dr. Steven Martina, said “We are very excited to partner with Microgaming and provide them with our world-class regulatory framework and infrastructure. This partnership is another step forward in Curacao’s mission to become the Caribbean’s premier igaming jurisdiction.”</p>
<p>Microgaming’s CEO, John Coleman, added “This is an important strategic move for us as we continue our growth strategy and expand into new markets. Curacao has a well-deserved reputation for being a high-quality jurisdiction with an outstanding regulator.”</p>
<p>The agreement is also good news for players in Latin America, who will now have access to some of the best gaming products in the world. With Microgaming’s experience in developing online casino games, they can look forward to playing some truly unique titles that they won’t find anywhere else.</p>

<p>The deal encompasses all casino and gaming content from Microgaming for both desktop and mobile platforms. The operator, which has not been named, will have access to over 600 games as well as the Quickfire platform.</p>
<p>Commenting on the deal, CEO of Microgaming David Reynolds said: “We are absolutely delighted to have entered into this agreement with such a prestigious and successful operator. Our desktop and mobile content will provide their players with an unrivalled gaming experience.”</p>
<p>This latest win for Microgaming comes hot on the heels of agreements with several other operators in recent months, including Videoslots.com, Trannel International and Vera&amp;John.</p>
<p>Curacao is a well-respected licensing jurisdiction that is popular with operators due to its favourable tax regime. In addition, the island is known for its rigorous regulatory framework which ensures a high standard of player protection.</p>

<p>Microgaming’s vice president of business development, David Reynolds, said: “Curacao is a quality jurisdiction with an excellent regulator in the form of the Curacao Gaming Authority.</p>
<p>“It also offers a favourable tax regime and a large pool of well-educated and English-speaking support staff. These factors, together with our long-standing relationship with the jurisdiction, make it an attractive place for us to do business.”</p>
<p>Microgaming currently supplies over 600 online casinos with its software, and this number looks set to grow as more and more operators seek to take advantage of Curacao’s gambling-friendly environment.</p>
<p>This increased interest is also good news for the people of Curacao, who are seeing new jobs and investment being generated as a result of the Microgaming boom.</p>

<p>The new framework will be aimed at both operators and players, and is expected to come into effect in the first quarter of 2019. The agreement between Microgaming and Curacao will also see the two entities co-operate on marketing and educational initiatives in order to promote responsible gaming practices.</p>
<p>Commenting on the partnership, Microgaming CEO John Coleman said: “We are committed to working with our partners at Curacao to create an environment that is both fair and safe for iGaming operators and players.</p>
<p>“Our aim is to provide a world-class experience for all involved, underpinned by responsible gaming practices. We are looking forward to launching our new content and services in Curacao in early 2019.”</p>
<p>Curacao’s Minister of Justice Cornelius de Weever also expressed his excitement about the partnership, noting that it would help position Curacao as a global leader when it comes to iGaming regulation.

<h1 id="Cognitive-Behavioral-Therapy-Proven-to-be-Most-Effective-for-Treating-Gambling-Addiction"><a href="#Cognitive-Behavioral-Therapy-Proven-to-be-Most-Effective-for-Treating-Gambling-Addiction" class="headerlink" title="Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy Proven to be Most Effective for Treating Gambling Addiction"></a>Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy Proven to be Most Effective for Treating Gambling Addiction</h1><p>According to a report recently released by the National Council on Problem Gambling, cognitive-behavioral therapy is the most effective treatment for gambling addiction. The report also found that medication and self-help groups are not as effective as CBT in helping people overcome their gambling addictions.</p>
<p>CBT is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on the relationship between thoughts, feelings and behaviors. CBT helps people become aware of how their thoughts and behaviors influence their emotions and vice versa. CBT can help people change the way they think and behave in order to better manage their addiction.</p>
<p>The National Council on Problem Gambling’s report was based on a review of scientific studies on the effectiveness of different treatments for gambling addiction. The study found that CBT is more effective than other treatments in helping people overcome their addictions. CBT was found to be more effective than medication, self-help groups, and behavioral marital therapy.</p>
<p>The study also found that CBT is more effective than placebo in treating gambling addictions. Placebo is a dummy treatment that has no real therapeutic value. In other words, CBT is more effective than doing nothing at all in helping people overcome their gambling addictions.</p>
<p>CBT has been shown to be an effective treatment for a variety of Addictions including alcohol addiction, drug addiction, and compulsive eating.</p>

<p>Fiorentina opened the scoring in the 18th minute when Giovanni Simeone finished off a counterattack. Napoli equalized in the 36th minute when Arkadiusz Milik headed in a Jorginho corner.</p>
<p>Milik then gave Napoli the lead in the 63rd minute with a powerful shot from outside the box, but Nikola Kalinic equalized for Fiorentina in the 73rd minute.</p>
<p>The draw leaves Napoli second in Serie A, four points behind leaders Juventus.</p>
<h1 id="Rodrigo-Becomes-First-Brazilian-to-Score-for-Fiorentina-in-Serie-A"><a href="#Rodrigo-Becomes-First-Brazilian-to-Score-for-Fiorentina-in-Serie-A" class="headerlink" title="Rodrigo Becomes First Brazilian to Score for Fiorentina in Serie A"></a>Rodrigo Becomes First Brazilian to Score for Fiorentina in Serie A</h1><p>Rodrigo Becomes First Brazilian to Score for Fiorentina in Serie A<br>Rodrigo has been a revelation for La Viola this season. The Brazilian international has scored seven goals in all competitions and his latest strike came in Saturday’s 2-0 home win over Atalanta. That was his first goal in Serie A and made him the first Brazilian to score for Fiorentina in the Italian top flight.<br>After several near-misses, Rodrigo finally got off the mark in style by converting a penalty early in the second half. The former Benfica striker drilled home decisively from the spot after Stefan Savic had been fouled by Alejandro Gomez.<br>That goal helped Fiorentina to secure their fourth successive league win, keeping them fifth in the standings, just two points behind fourth-placed Lazio. Vincenzo Montella’s side are now unbeaten in their last eight games in all competitions and will be looking to continue that run when they take on Crotone at home next weekend.</p>

<p>Juan Cuadrado’s fourth-minute strike was all that separated the two sides on Sunday afternoon as Fiorentina ran out 1-0 winners over Cagliari.</p>
<p>The Colombian international’s early goal settled any nerves in the Viola camp and they were able to see the game out relatively comfortably, despite Mauro Icardi going close for the visitors with a curling free-kick in the second half.</p>
<p>Cuadrado’s goal was his first of the campaign and it will be a relief for both him and manager Vincenzo Montella, who have been coming in for criticism recently.</p>
<p>With this win, Fiorentina move up to eighth place in the Serie A table, just one point behind Inter Milan, who occupy the final Europa League qualification spot.<br> …</p>
<h1 id="Falcinelli-Nets-Winner-as-Fiorentina-Edges-Sassuolo"><a href="#Falcinelli-Nets-Winner-as-Fiorentina-Edges-Sassuolo" class="headerlink" title="Falcinelli Nets Winner as Fiorentina Edges Sassuolo"></a>Falcinelli Nets Winner as Fiorentina Edges Sassuolo</h1><p>The Serie A season resumed over the weekend, with a number of matchups taking place. One of the most notable results saw Fiorentina edge Sassuolo 2-1, as Leonardo Falcinelli netted the winner in stoppage time.</p>
<p>Both teams had chances in an exciting first half, but it was Sassuolo who took the lead shortly after the break when Jeremie Boga converted from close range. However, Fiorentina were not to be denied and equalized soon afterwards through Marco Benassi.</p>
<p>With the game looking like it would end in a draw, Falcinelli popped up with a late winner to give his side all three points. The win sees Fiorentina move up to fourth in the table, while Sassuolo remain in 10th.</p>
<h1 id="ACF-Fiorentina-Get-off-to-Winning-Start"><a href="#ACF-Fiorentina-Get-off-to-Winning-Start" class="headerlink" title="ACF Fiorentina Get off to Winning Start"></a>ACF Fiorentina Get off to Winning Start</h1><p>ACF Fiorentina beat SSC Napoli in the opening game of the Serie A TIM 2017&#x2F;18 season at the San Paolo Stadium.</p>
<p>Jorginho had the first opportunity of the game in the 2nd minute when he shot over from outside the area after being set up by Lorenzo Insigne.<br>The home side took control of the game after that, with goalkeeper Alex Meret making a couple of saves to keep them at bay.<br>Insigne had a good chance to open the scoring on 27 minutes but his effort from distance went just wide of the target.</p>
<p>The deadlock was finally broken on 38 minutes when Jorginho’s free-kick was headed in by Jose Callejon.<br>Napoli could have doubled their lead before halftime but Dries Mertens’ header came back off the crossbar.</p>
<p>The visitors started brightly after the break and were unlucky not to level matters on 49 minutes when Davide Astori’s header came back off the post.<br>However, they did get themselves back into the game on 57 minutes when Giovanni Simeone scored with a great finish following good work from Federico Chiesa.<br>Chiesa then hit the post himself a few minutes later as Fiorentina looked for a winner.<br>Meret made another save to deny substitute Nikola Kalinic in stoppage time as Napoli held on for a narrow victory.</p>
