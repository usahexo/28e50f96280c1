<h1 id="Cognitive-Behavioral-Therapy-Proven-to-be-Most-Effective-for-Treating-Gambling-Addiction"><a href="#Cognitive-Behavioral-Therapy-Proven-to-be-Most-Effective-for-Treating-Gambling-Addiction" class="headerlink" title="Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy Proven to be Most Effective for Treating Gambling Addiction"></a>Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy Proven to be Most Effective for Treating Gambling Addiction</h1><p>According to a report recently released by the National Council on Problem Gambling, cognitive-behavioral therapy is the most effective treatment for gambling addiction. The report also found that medication and self-help groups are not as effective as CBT in helping people overcome their gambling addictions.</p>
<p>CBT is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on the relationship between thoughts, feelings and behaviors. CBT helps people become aware of how their thoughts and behaviors influence their emotions and vice versa. CBT can help people change the way they think and behave in order to better manage their addiction.</p>
<p>The National Council on Problem Gambling’s report was based on a review of scientific studies on the effectiveness of different treatments for gambling addiction. The study found that CBT is more effective than other treatments in helping people overcome their addictions. CBT was found to be more effective than medication, self-help groups, and behavioral marital therapy.</p>
<p>The study also found that CBT is more effective than placebo in treating gambling addictions. Placebo is a dummy treatment that has no real therapeutic value. In other words, CBT is more effective than doing nothing at all in helping people overcome their gambling addictions.</p>
<p>CBT has been shown to be an effective treatment for a variety of Addictions including alcohol addiction, drug addiction, and compulsive eating.</p>

However, recovery is possible with the right tools and resources. This article will outline how you can overcome a gambling addiction and improve your life.</p>

<p>Another key component of overcoming a gambling addiction is developing healthy habits. This includes things like exercise, eating healthy foods, and getting enough sleep. When you’re healthy both physically and mentally, it’s much easier to resist temptation and stay on track with your recovery goals.</p>
<p>Finally, it’s important to remember that relapse is common for people recovering from addictions. Don’t let one setback discourage you from continuing on your road to recovery. If you slip up or feel like giving up, reach out for help from your support system or therapist. With time and effort, you can overcome your gambling addiction and live a happier, healthier life.</p>

<p>Fiorentina opened the scoring in the 18th minute when Giovanni Simeone finished off a counterattack. Napoli equalized in the 36th minute when Arkadiusz Milik headed in a Jorginho corner.</p>
<p>Milik then gave Napoli the lead in the 63rd minute with a powerful shot from outside the box, but Nikola Kalinic equalized for Fiorentina in the 73rd minute.</p>
<p>The draw leaves Napoli second in Serie A, four points behind leaders Juventus.</p>
<h1 id="Rodrigo-Becomes-First-Brazilian-to-Score-for-Fiorentina-in-Serie-A"><a href="#Rodrigo-Becomes-First-Brazilian-to-Score-for-Fiorentina-in-Serie-A" class="headerlink" title="Rodrigo Becomes First Brazilian to Score for Fiorentina in Serie A"></a>Rodrigo Becomes First Brazilian to Score for Fiorentina in Serie A</h1><p>Rodrigo Becomes First Brazilian to Score for Fiorentina in Serie A<br>Rodrigo has been a revelation for La Viola this season. The Brazilian international has scored seven goals in all competitions and his latest strike came in Saturday’s 2-0 home win over Atalanta. That was his first goal in Serie A and made him the first Brazilian to score for Fiorentina in the Italian top flight.<br>After several near-misses, Rodrigo finally got off the mark in style by converting a penalty early in the second half. The former Benfica striker drilled home decisively from the spot after Stefan Savic had been fouled by Alejandro Gomez.<br>That goal helped Fiorentina to secure their fourth successive league win, keeping them fifth in the standings, just two points behind fourth-placed Lazio. Vincenzo Montella’s side are now unbeaten in their last eight games in all competitions and will be looking to continue that run when they take on Crotone at home next weekend.</p>
<h1 id="Cuadrado-Scores-as-Fiorentina-Defeats-Cagliari"><a href="#Cuadrado-Scores-as-Fiorentina-Defeats-Cagliari" class="headerlink" title="Cuadrado Scores as Fiorentina Defeats Cagliari"></a>Cuadrado Scores as Fiorentina Defeats Cagliari</h1><p>Cuadrado Scores as Fiorentina Defeats Cagliari</p>
<p>Juan Cuadrado’s fourth-minute strike was all that separated the two sides on Sunday afternoon as Fiorentina ran out 1-0 winners over Cagliari.</p>
<p>The Colombian international’s early goal settled any nerves in the Viola camp and they were able to see the game out relatively comfortably, despite Mauro Icardi going close for the visitors with a curling free-kick in the second half.</p>
<p>Cuadrado’s goal was his first of the campaign and it will be a relief for both him and manager Vincenzo Montella, who have been coming in for criticism recently.</p>
<p>With this win, Fiorentina move up to eighth place in the Serie A table, just one point behind Inter Milan, who occupy the final Europa League qualification spot.<br> …</p>
<h1 id="Falcinelli-Nets-Winner-as-Fiorentina-Edges-Sassuolo"><a href="#Falcinelli-Nets-Winner-as-Fiorentina-Edges-Sassuolo" class="headerlink" title="Falcinelli Nets Winner as Fiorentina Edges Sassuolo"></a>Falcinelli Nets Winner as Fiorentina Edges Sassuolo</h1><p>The Serie A season resumed over the weekend, with a number of matchups taking place. One of the most notable results saw Fiorentina edge Sassuolo 2-1, as Leonardo Falcinelli netted the winner in stoppage time.</p>
<p>Both teams had chances in an exciting first half, but it was Sassuolo who took the lead shortly after the break when Jeremie Boga converted from close range. However, Fiorentina were not to be denied and equalized soon afterwards through Marco Benassi.</p>
<p>With the game looking like it would end in a draw, Falcinelli popped up with a late winner to give his side all three points. The win sees Fiorentina move up to fourth in the table, while Sassuolo remain in 10th.</p>
<h1 id="ACF-Fiorentina-Get-off-to-Winning-Start"><a href="#ACF-Fiorentina-Get-off-to-Winning-Start" class="headerlink" title="ACF Fiorentina Get off to Winning Start"></a>ACF Fiorentina Get off to Winning Start</h1><p>ACF Fiorentina beat SSC Napoli in the opening game of the Serie A TIM 2017&#x2F;18 season at the San Paolo Stadium.</p>
<p>Jorginho had the first opportunity of the game in the 2nd minute when he shot over from outside the area after being set up by Lorenzo Insigne.<br>The home side took control of the game after that, with goalkeeper Alex Meret making a couple of saves to keep them at bay.<br>Insigne had a good chance to open the scoring on 27 minutes but his effort from distance went just wide of the target.</p>
<p>The deadlock was finally broken on 38 minutes when Jorginho’s free-kick was headed in by Jose Callejon.<br>Napoli could have doubled their lead before halftime but Dries Mertens’ header came back off the crossbar.</p>
<p>The visitors started brightly after the break and were unlucky not to level matters on 49 minutes when Davide Astori’s header came back off the post.<br>However, they did get themselves back into the game on 57 minutes when Giovanni Simeone scored with a great finish following good work from Federico Chiesa.<br>Chiesa then hit the post himself a few minutes later as Fiorentina looked for a winner.<br>Meret made another save to deny substitute Nikola Kalinic in stoppage time as Napoli held on for a narrow victory.</p>
