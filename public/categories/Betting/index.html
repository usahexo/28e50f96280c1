Expert reveals the best way to play!"></a>Blackjack why just one hit? Expert reveals the best way to play!</h1><p>Countering the dealer’s up-card with a hit is one of the worst decisions you can make in blackjack, says seasoned pro.</p>
<p>“A lot of people just hit blindly because they see that the dealer has a good card,” commented blackjack expert James Grosjean. “But that’s actually not the best move – especially if your hand is strong.”</p>
<p>Grosjean recommends doubling down instead – especially when you have an 11 or 12.</p>
<p>“If the dealer is showing a 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, then you should definitely double down,” he advised. “You have a decent chance of getting closer to 21 this way, and you also won’t risk losing as much money if the dealer manages to pull ahead.”</p>
<p>Grosjean also said that standing on 17 is usually a good move – unless the dealer is showing an Ace. In that case, he recommends hitting unless you have an 18 or higher.</p>
<p>So next time you hit the casino floor, make sure to remember these tips from Grosjean – and maybe you can walk away with more chips than when you arrived!</p>

One player thinks so after losing big!"></a>Could blackjack be rigged? One player thinks so after losing big!</h1><p>A blackjack player is claiming that the game may be rigged, after losing a large amount of money.</p>
<p>The player, who asked to remain anonymous, said that he had been playing at a casino in downtown Las Vegas when he started to notice some strange happenings. He began to lose systematically, and no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t seem to win.</p>
<p>Suspecting that something was wrong, the player requested a copy of the security footage from the casino. When he watched it back, he was shocked to see that the dealer appeared to be helping certain players and making it harder for him to win.</p>
<p>He has since filed a complaint with the Nevada Gaming Commission and is calling for an investigation into the casino’s practices.</p>
<p>So is blackjack rigged? While it’s certainly possible, there’s no concrete evidence that this is actually happening at casinos around the world. If you do suspect that something fishy is going on, it’s best to speak to customer support or management and see if they can help clear things up.</p>

Do you feel like you could be doing better if you only knew some insider tips? Look no further – we’re going to reveal the secret to winning at blackjack right here!</p>
<ol>
<li>Learn the basic rules of the game</li>
</ol>
<p>The first step to becoming a blackjack master is to learn the basics of the game. Blackjack is a relatively simple game, but there are a few basic rules that you need to know in order to play correctly. Once you have mastered the rules, move on to learning some more advanced techniques.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Practice, practice, practice!</li>
</ol>
<p>Like any other skill, playing blackjack requires practice in order to improve. The more you play, the better you will become at making smart decisions and winning money. So hit up your local casino or online casino and start playing today!</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Know when to hit and when to stand</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the most important skills you need to develop as a blackjack player is knowing when to hit and when to stand. If you hit too often, you may end up busting (going over 21). If you stand too often, you may lose out on potential wins. It takes time and experience to figure out the right setting for each hand, but it’s worth it once you start winning more consistently.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Use basic strategy charts</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you have a good understanding of when to hit and when to stand, it’s time to start using basic strategy charts. These charts will give you the optimal decision for every possible situation at the blackjack table. There are many different charts available online, so be sure to choose one that fits your playing style.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Understand how cards are valued</li>
</ol>
<p>In blackjack, cards are valued as follows: 2 through 10 are worth their face value, an ace can be worth 1 or 11, and all other cards are worth zero points. This knowledge is essential in making sound decisions while playing the game. For example, if you have an Ace and a 6 (totaling 17), you should always stand because hitting would likely result in a bust.</p>
<h1 id="The-one-mistake-you-don’t-want-to-make-when-playing-blackjack"><a href="#The-one-mistake-you-don’t-want-to-make-when-playing-blackjack" class="headerlink" title="The one mistake you don’t want to make when playing blackjack"></a>The one mistake you don’t want to make when playing blackjack</h1><p>When playing blackjack, there are a few key things you need to remember in order to give yourself the best chance of winning. Of course, luck also plays a part, but if you make the following mistake, you’re likely to end up losing money.</p>
<p>The mistake we’re talking about is splitting your cards. When you’re dealt two cards of the same value, it can be tempting to split them and try and make two hands out of them. However, this is usually not a good idea, as you’ll usually end up with worse hands than if you had just stuck with one.</p>
<p>There are a few exceptions to this rule - for example, if you have two aces, splitting them is usually a good idea. But for the most part, it’s best to just stick with one card. This will give you a better chance of winning the hand and avoiding big losses.</p>
<h1 id="Why-hitting-on-17-can-be-a-bad-move-even-if-the-dealer-is-showing-a-6"><a href="#Why-hitting-on-17-can-be-a-bad-move-even-if-the-dealer-is-showing-a-6" class="headerlink" title="Why hitting on 17 can be a bad move - even if the dealer is showing a 6"></a>Why hitting on 17 can be a bad move - even if the dealer is showing a 6</h1><p>When it comes to playing blackjack, most players know that the general rule of thumb is to hit on any hand totaling 17 or less, and stand on any hand totaling 18 or more. But what many players may not know is that there are some exceptions to this rule - and one of those exceptions is when the dealer is showing a 6.</p>
<p>In this scenario, even though it may be tempting to hit on 17 instead of standing, it’s actually a bad move to do so. That’s because the dealer has a high chance of busting with a 6, and if they do, you’ll end up losing your bet even if you would have otherwise won the hand.</p>
<p>It’s important to remember that blackjack is a game of odds, and in most cases, it’s better to play it safe than take unnecessary risks. So if the dealer is showing a 6, always stand on 17 - no matter how tempting it may be to hit.</p>

        <h1 id="Fenerbahce-Holds-Its-Own-In-The-Poker-World"><a href="#Fenerbahce-Holds-Its-Own-In-The-Poker-World" class="headerlink" title="Fenerbahçe Holds Its Own In The Poker World"></a>Fenerbahçe Holds Its Own In The Poker World</h1><p>Fenerbahçe SK, founded in 1907, is one of the most successful and popular sports clubs in Turkey. The club has teams in a variety of sports, but is best known for its football team, which has won 19 Turkish Super Lig championships and 5 Turkish Cups.</p>
<p>Like any other sport, poker has gained a large following in Turkey, and especially among Fenerbahçe fans. In fact, the club has a number of professional poker players on its roster, including Atakan Karaböcek, who has over $1.5 million in career earnings.</p>
<p>Karaböcek started playing poker in 2007 and soon found success. In 2009, he won the World Poker Tour (WPT) title at the Bellagio Cup IV event in Las Vegas for $1.2 million. He followed that up with another victory at an event at the Borgata Hotel Casino &amp; Spa in Atlantic City, taking down $872,000.</p>
<p>Aside from Karaböcek, there are other members of the Fenerbahçe poker team who have had some success on the international stage. Cüneyt Kanbay finished 3rd at the 2017 Aussie Millions Main Event for over A$1 million and Tayfun Erman took down an event at the PokerStars Festival London for £69,600 (approx. $92,000).</p>
<p>The 2017 European Poker Tour (EPT) stop in Barcelona was also a big success for Fenerbahçe players. Can Bayindir took 4th place in the €10K High Roller for €236,000 and Burak Akcay cashed twice – once in the €5K Deepstack Turbo for €19,700 and again in the €25K High Roller for €101,200.</p>
<p>With such a talented and successful team of poker players, it’s no wonder that Fenerbahçe is considered a force to be reckoned with in the poker world.</p>
<h1 id="Fenerbahce-Continues-To-Excel-In-The-Poker-World"><a href="#Fenerbahce-Continues-To-Excel-In-The-Poker-World" class="headerlink" title="Fenerbahçe Continues To Excel In The Poker World"></a>Fenerbahçe Continues To Excel In The Poker World</h1><p>Fenerbahçe, one of the most successful and popular professional football clubs in Turkey, is also a big name in the poker world. The club has a dedicated team of players who have not only represented Turkey on the international stage but have also won some of the biggest tournaments in the industry.</p>
<p>The Fenerbahçe Poker Team has a long and proud history dating back to 2007 when it first emerged as a contender in Turkish poker circles. The team’s first major victory came in 2009 when team captain Murat Aydın won the Main Event at the Bodrum Cup. Aydın would go on to dominate Turkish poker, winning numerous titles and cementing Fenerbahçe’s reputation as one of the top teams in the country.</p>
<p>In 2010, Fenerbahçe made its debut on the global stage by competing in the World Series of Poker Europe (WSOPE). The team put up a strong performance, with four players making it to the final table of various events. The following year saw even more success at WSOPE, with two players taking home gold bracelets.</p>
<p>Fenerbahçe’s greatest achievement to date came in 2014 when captain Çetin Cevik won the prestigious World Poker Tour (WPT) Berlin Main Event. This victory made Fenerbahçe not only one of the best poker clubs in Turkey but also one of the most respected clubs in Europe.</p>
<p>Since its inception, Fenerbahçe Poker Team has produced some of Turkey’s top poker talent including Cevik, Aydın, and Hasan Karaşahin. These players have represented their country with distinction at some of the world’s most prestigious tournaments, showing that Turkish poker is a force to be reckoned with.</p>
<h1 id="Dominating-Performance-From-Fenerbahce-In-Poker-World"><a href="#Dominating-Performance-From-Fenerbahce-In-Poker-World" class="headerlink" title="Dominating Performance From Fenerbahçe In Poker World"></a>Dominating Performance From Fenerbahçe In Poker World</h1><p>Poker is a game that has been around for centuries, and it is still one of the most popular card games in the world.

<h1 id="Fenerbahce-On-Top-Of-The-Poker-World"><a href="#Fenerbahce-On-Top-Of-The-Poker-World" class="headerlink" title="Fenerbahce On Top Of The Poker World"></a>Fenerbahce On Top Of The Poker World</h1><p>The Turkish club Fenerbahce has been the talk of the poker world this week, after they managed to win the prestigious €1 million buy-in PokerStars European Championship (PEC). The event, which took place in Rozvadov, Czech Republic, saw a field of 183 players take to the felt, with Fenerbahce emerging victorious.</p>
<p>The team comprising of Mustafa “Kelebek” Kutluay, Zeki Yuksel, Orhan Beyaz and Hasan Karakaya bested a star-studded final table that included the likes of Team PokerStars Pro Marcel Luske and Sweden’s Martin Jacobson. This was Kelebek’s second major title in as many months – he won the €100,000 Super High Roller at the Barcelona casino last month.</p>
<p>Speaking after their victory, Kelebek said: “This feels amazing. I can’t believe I have won two big tournaments in a row. We all played really well and it’s great to get the team trophy as well.”</p>
<p>The Fenerbahce victory has added further weight to the argument that Turkish poker is on the rise. In recent years, Turkish players have been making their presence felt on the global stage, with Kutluay, Yuksel and Karakaya joining an illustrious list of Turkish poker stars that includes Ekrem Atiker and Cem Say.</p>
<p>The fact that Fenerbahce have now won two of the biggest tournaments in Europe only confirms their status as one of the top clubs in world poker.</p>
<h1 id="Unstoppable-Force-Fenerbahce-Crushes-Competition-In-Poker"><a href="#Unstoppable-Force-Fenerbahce-Crushes-Competition-In-Poker" class="headerlink" title="Unstoppable Force: Fenerbahçe Crushes Competition In Poker"></a>Unstoppable Force: Fenerbahçe Crushes Competition In Poker</h1><p>The Fenerbahçe Poker team is on a roll.</p>
<p>After taking home the top prize in the European Online Poker Championship last month, they’ve now crushed their competition in the Fuller Poker Turkish Cup.</p>
<p>The tournament took place from March 9-11 and featured 135 teams from around the country.</p>
<p>Fenerbahçe easily outpaced the competition, taking first place with a total of 3,023 points. Second-place Ataşehir Casino managed just 1,548 points.</p>
<p>The winnings were impressive too. Fenerbahçe walked away with a total of TL 50,000 (approx. $11,000), while Ataşehir Casino had to settle for TL 20,000 (approx. $4,500).</p>
<p>This is the latest in a long string of successes for the Fenerbahçe Poker team. In addition to their successes in Europe and Turkey, they’ve also won numerous international tournaments over the years.</p>
<p>There’s no doubt that this team is one of the best in the world – and they’re only getting better!</p>
