For example, if you’re looking for a more casino-like experience, Japan may be a good place to go; whereas if you’re interested in hunting dinosaurs, then Alberta may be a better option. Do some research ahead of time so that you know what kinds of games and experiences to look for in the places that you’ll be visiting.</p>
<p>Finally, don’t forget to take advantage of local game rental stores. Not only is this a great way to try out new games before buying them, but it’s also a great way to meet locals who may be able to show you around town and give you some tips on the best places to eat and visit.</p>

        <h1 id="Minimum-age-for-casino-gambling-in-Pennsylvania-is-21"><a href="#Minimum-age-for-casino-gambling-in-Pennsylvania-is-21" class="headerlink" title="Minimum age for casino gambling in Pennsylvania is 21"></a>Minimum age for casino gambling in Pennsylvania is 21</h1><p>The minimum age for casino gambling in Pennsylvania is 21. This applies to all forms of casino gambling, including slot machines, table games, and poker.</p>
<p>The rationale for the minimum age of 21 is that it is the age at which young adults are considered to be adults in the United States. Many other activities that require adults-only participation, such as purchasing alcohol or voting, also have a minimum age of 21.</p>
<p>There are some exceptions to the minimum age requirement for casino gambling in Pennsylvania. There are three casinos in the state that are open to those 18 and older: Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course, Lady Luck Casino Nemacolin, and Parx Casino. These casinos are located on Native American reservations, and the tribes that own them are exempt from following Pennsylvania state law.</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania-casinos-have-set-the-minimum-age-to-enter-at-21"><a href="#Pennsylvania-casinos-have-set-the-minimum-age-to-enter-at-21" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania casinos have set the minimum age to enter at 21"></a>Pennsylvania casinos have set the minimum age to enter at 21</h1><p>Officials in Pennsylvania have set the minimum age to enter a casino at 21 years old. This decision was made in light of the new gambling law that was recently passed in the state. The new law allows for up to 10 casinos to be built in Pennsylvania, and those casinos will be open to those who are at least 21 years old.</p>
<p>There has been some controversy surrounding the minimum age requirement, as some people feel that it is too restrictive. They argue that it will keep many young people from being able to enjoy what the casinos have to offer. However, officials feel that this is a necessary step in order to ensure that there is responsible gambling in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>It is hoped that the minimum age requirement will help to prevent gambling addiction among young people. It will also help to ensure that those who do gamble are of legal age and are thus able to make informed decisions about their spending.</p>
<h1 id="You-must-be-at-least-21-years-old-to-gamble-in-a-PA-casino"><a href="#You-must-be-at-least-21-years-old-to-gamble-in-a-PA-casino" class="headerlink" title="You must be at least 21 years old to gamble in a PA casino"></a>You must be at least 21 years old to gamble in a PA casino</h1><p>The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) oversees all gambling in the state of Pennsylvania. The Board is tasked with ensuring the integrity and security of the gaming industry, and also with regulating casino gambling so that it is fair and safe for citizens. One of the ways the PGCB does this is by making sure that only those over 21 are allowed to gamble in a PA casino.</p>
<p>There are a few exceptions to this rule - namely, those who are 18 or older may gamble in a PA casino if they are accompanied by someone over 21. In addition, anyone under 18 is not allowed in a casino at all, regardless of accompaniment. This regulation exists to protect citizens from underage gambling, which can lead to problems such as addiction, financial instability, and crime.</p>
<p>The PGCB also regulates other forms of gambling in Pennsylvania, including horseracing, lottery games, and charitable gaming. For more information on these activities, please visit the PGCB website or contact them directly.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-entry-age-increased-to-21-in-Pennsylvania"><a href="#Casino-entry-age-increased-to-21-in-Pennsylvania" class="headerlink" title="Casino entry age increased to 21 in Pennsylvania"></a>Casino entry age increased to 21 in Pennsylvania</h1><p>On October 6, 2017, the Pennsylvania Senate passed a bill that will increase the minimum age to enter a casino from 18 to 21. The bill, which is now in the House for consideration, will also prohibit those younger than 21 from playing gambling games.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill argue that it is needed to protect minors and vulnerable populations from the dangers of gambling. Critics say that the measure will simply drive younger people to gamble illegally.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania is not the first state to increase the casino entry age. In 2013, New Jersey increased its minimum age from 18 to 21. Maine followed suit in 2016, raising its minimum age from 18 to 21.</p>
<p>The passage of this bill in Pennsylvania comes at a time when gambling is becoming increasingly popular among young people. A study by Camelot Strategic Marketing found that 54% of millennials had gambled in the past year, up from 46% in 2014.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction can have serious consequences for young people. It can lead to financial problems, ruined relationships, and even suicide.</p>
<p>If you are concerned about someone you know who may be addicted to gambling, there are resources available to help you. The National Council on Problem Gambling has a toll-free helpline at 1-800-522-4700 that can provide information and support.</p>
<h1 id="Minimum-age-to-enter-a-casino-in-PA-is-now-21"><a href="#Minimum-age-to-enter-a-casino-in-PA-is-now-21" class="headerlink" title="Minimum age to enter a casino in PA is now 21"></a>Minimum age to enter a casino in PA is now 21</h1><p>As of September 1, 2019, the minimum age to enter a casino in Pennsylvania is 21. The previously-established minimum age of 18 no longer applies.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) made the announcement on August 22, 2019. In a press release, the PGCB said that the change was made in order to “promote public safety and better protect casino patrons and employees.”</p>
<p>Pennsylvania is not the first state to raise the minimum age for casino entry; both Michigan and New Jersey have set the age at 21. Illinois is among the states considering a similar change.</p>
<p>The move by the PGCB has been met with mixed reactions. On one hand, some people argue that it will help keep minors from being exposed to gambling and other unhealthy activities in casinos. On the other hand, others worry that it will simply push underage gamblers underground, where they will be less likely to be monitored or prevented from harm.</p>
<p>Casinos in Pennsylvania brought in more than $2.3 billion in revenue last year, so it’s clear that they are a major part of the state economy. With this change in policy, it will be interesting to see how casino operators and patrons adjust – and whether or not this leads to any changes in gambling habits among Pennsylvanians.</p>
