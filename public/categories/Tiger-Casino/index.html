        <h1 id="Delaware-becomes-first-state-to-legalize-online-gambling"><a href="#Delaware-becomes-first-state-to-legalize-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Delaware becomes first state to legalize online gambling"></a>Delaware becomes first state to legalize online gambling</h1><p>The state of Delaware has become the first in the US to legalize online gambling, with Governor Jack Markell signing the bill into law on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Online poker and casino games will be available to players in Delaware from October, with the state expecting to generate around $7 million in annual revenue from licensing fees.</p>
<p>“This is about economic development,” said Governor Markell. “It’s about creating jobs and bringing new money into our state.”</p>
<p>The move is seen as a significant step forward for the online gambling industry, with other states likely to follow Delaware’s lead. Nevada and New Jersey have also legalized online gambling, but have yet to launch any commercial operations.</p>
<p>Delaware’s new law allows casinos to partner with internet gaming providers, who will be responsible for handling customer registrations, payments and security. Players must be physically located within Delaware in order to gamble online.</p>
<p>Opponents of online gambling argue that it can be addictive and lead to financial problems, but supporters say that it is a safe and secure way to enjoy casino games from the comfort of your own home.</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania-legalizes-online-gambling"><a href="#Pennsylvania-legalizes-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania legalizes online gambling"></a>Pennsylvania legalizes online gambling</h1><p>On October 26, 2017, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf signed into law a bill legalizing online gambling in the state. The move marks a watershed moment for the gaming industry in the United States, as Pennsylvania is now the fourth state to legalize online gambling, after New Jersey, Nevada, and Delaware.</p>
<p>The new law allows for both casino-style games and poker to be played online in Pennsylvania, with licenses starting at $10 million per operator. It is expected that the first wave of legalized online gambling will go live in Pennsylvania in early 2018.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of legalizing online gambling is that it is expected to generate significant tax revenue for the state. According to estimates from the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB), the new law could bring in as much as $200 million annually in tax revenue. This would be a major boon for Pennsylvania, which is currently facing a budget crisis.</p>
<p>Online gambling has been growing rapidly in popularity in recent years. In 2016, casino gaming revenue in the United States was estimated at $24.7 billion, with over half of that ($13.2 billion) generated from online and mobile gaming sources. It is clear that there is a large and growing market for online gambling, and states are increasingly looking to tap into this market by legalizing it.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons why states are moving to legalize online gambling. One major reason is that it can provide a significant source of revenue for states. As mentioned earlier, Pennsylvania expects to bring in $200 million annually in tax revenue from online gambling. Other states have also seen positive results from legalizing online gambling. For example, New Jersey generated over $180 million in tax revenue from online gambling in 2016 alone.</p>
<p>Another reason states are legalizing online gambling is because it can help support their local economy and create jobs. For example, operators who receive licenses to offer online gambling in Pennsylvania will be required to have their servers located within the state. This will create jobs and boost the economy in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Legalizing online gambling can also help combat illegal betting operations. By legalizing and regulating online gambling, states can ensure that players are playing on safe and fair websites and that all taxes and revenues are properly collected. This helps protect consumers and ensures that governments receive any benefits that may come from legalized gambling operations.</p>
<p>While there are many benefits to legalizing online gambling, there are also some potential downsides to consider. One concern is that legalization could lead to an increase in problem or addicted gamblers. However, research on this topic has been mixed, with some studies indicating that legalization does lead to an increase in problem gamblers while others indicating no significant change or even a decrease in problem gamblers rates following legalization.</p>
<p>Another concern is that legalized online gambling could hurt brick-and-mortar casinos located within a state. This could happen if people shift their spending away from physical casinos towards legalized online casinos. However, at this point it is unclear how much impact legalized online casinos will have on physical casinos – this remains an area of ongoing research .</p>
<h1 id="New-York-legalizes-online-gambling"><a href="#New-York-legalizes-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="New York legalizes online gambling"></a>New York legalizes online gambling</h1><p>In a landmark decision on Monday, the New York State Gaming Commission voted unanimously to legalize online gambling. This decision opens up a new frontier in the gaming industry and is expected to generate millions of dollars in revenue for the state government.</p>
<p>As part of the new regulations, residents of New York will be able to gamble on websites operated by the state’s nine commercial casinos. These sites will offer a variety of games, including blackjack, roulette, and poker.</p>
<p>Online gambling has been illegal in New York since 2006, when then-Governor George Pataki signed a bill into law that banned the activity. However, this new ruling provides for a more liberal regulatory framework that is designed to protect consumers and ensure that casinos are not exploited by offshore operators.</p>
<p>Commission chairman James Featherstonhaugh said that the decision was based on “the belief that we can provide a safe and secure experience for New Yorkers who want to wager online.” He added that the commission would “closely monitor” the industry to make sure that players are treated fairly and that there is no “corruption or other criminal behavior.”</p>
<p>Supporters of online gambling say that it will generate much-needed revenue for the state government at a time when tax revenues are declining. They also argue that it will create jobs and stimulate economic growth.</p>
<p>Opponents of online gambling say that it is addictive and can lead to financial ruin for vulnerable individuals. They also contend that it is difficult to regulate, and that there is a risk of fraud and money laundering.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-legalizes-online-gambling"><a href="#Nevada-legalizes-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Nevada legalizes online gambling"></a>Nevada legalizes online gambling</h1><p>Nevada has become the first state to legalize online gambling, in a move that is expected to spark a flurry of similar legislation in other states. The new law allows Nevadans to place bets online or on their mobile phones, and will come into effect in early 2013.</p>
<p> Supporters of the new law say it will help to revive Nevada’s struggling casino industry, which has been hit hard by the economic downturn. They believe that online gambling will attract more players to Nevada’s casinos, and generate more revenue for the state.</p>
<p>Opponents of the new law argue that it could lead to addiction and gambling problems among Nevada residents. They also claim that it will be difficult to regulate and could be used by criminals to launder money.</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, the Nevada legislature passed the bill by a vote of 27-13, and Governor Brian Sandoval signed it into law on October 10, 2011.</p>
<h1 id="California-legalizes-online-gambling"><a href="#California-legalizes-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="California legalizes online gambling"></a>California legalizes online gambling</h1><p>On October 15, 2018, Californians voted in favor of legalizing online gambling. This makes California the fourth state in the US to legalize some form of internet gambling. The law will go into effect on January 1, 2019.</p>
<p>The new law allows residents 21 years or older to gamble on casino games, poker, and sports betting from their smartphones or computers. Online casinos must be licensed by the state and pay a 15 percent tax on gross gaming revenues.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill say it will generate much-needed revenue for the state budget and create jobs in the casino industry. Opponents argue that it will lead to more problem gambling and addiction.</p>
<p>So far, only three online casinos have obtained licenses from the state. They are Golden Nugget, Betfair US, and Pala Interactive. More are expected to apply in the coming months.</p>

        <h1 id="Delaware-legalizes-online-gambling"><a href="#Delaware-legalizes-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Delaware legalizes online gambling"></a>Delaware legalizes online gambling</h1><p>The state of Delaware has legalized online gambling, becoming the first state in the US to do so. This is a major development in the world of online gambling, as it could pave the way for other states to follow suit.</p>
<p>Delaware’s new law allows people aged 21 and over to gamble online, including casino games, poker and sports betting. Players will be able to place bets through the websites of Delaware’s three licensed casinos: Delaware Park, Dover Downs and Harrington Raceway.</p>
<p>The passage of this law is seen as a major victory for the gambling industry, as it opens up a new market for online casinos and gaming providers. It is also expected to create jobs and generate revenue for the state of Delaware.</p>
<p>The legalization of online gambling in Delaware could have implications for other states in the US, as it could provide a blueprint for how they can legalize and regulate the industry. There is growing momentum behind legalizing online gambling, as more people are turning to the internet to gamble.</p>
<p>The legalization of online gambling in Delaware is good news for players too, as they now have access to a range of top-quality casino games and betting options. Players can enjoy all their favorite casino games from the comfort of their own home, with no need to travel to a physical casino.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-legalizes-online-gambling"><a href="#Nevada-legalizes-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Nevada legalizes online gambling"></a>Nevada legalizes online gambling</h1><p>The Nevada State Assembly has voted in favor of a bill that would legalize online gambling within the state. The measure now goes to the Senate for approval.</p>
<p>Senator Mark Lipparelli, sponsor of the bill, believes that legalizing online gambling will provide a much-needed boost to the state’s economy. “This is a jobs bill,” he said.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill argue that it will lead to increased gambling addiction and social problems. But Lipparelli dismissed those concerns, saying that “the current law is not preventing people from gambling online.”</p>
<p>Under the proposed bill, internet poker would be legalized and regulated by the Nevada Gaming Commission. Players would have to be at least 21 years old and located within Nevada’s borders in order to participate.</p>
<p>If approved by the Senate, the measure would go into effect on January 1, 2013.</p>
<h1 id="New-Jersey-legalizes-online-gambling"><a href="#New-Jersey-legalizes-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey legalizes online gambling"></a>New Jersey legalizes online gambling</h1><p>On October 6, 2017, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie signed into law a bill that legalized online gambling in the state. The new law allows licensed casinos in New Jersey to offer online poker, casino games, and slots to players located within the state boundaries.</p>
<p>Governor Christie hailed the move as a major victory for the state’s $24 billion gaming industry. He noted that the bill would create “hundreds of new jobs” and generate millions of dollars in tax revenue for the state.</p>
<p>Opponents of online gambling argue that it is addictive and can lead to compulsive gambling behavior. They also express concern that it can be used by criminal organizations to launder money.</p>
<p>Supporters of online gambling argue that it is a safe and convenient way to gamble, and that it can be monitored to ensure player safety. They also point out that online gambling is already popular in other countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia, and that it has generated billions of dollars in revenue for those jurisdictions.</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania-legalizes-online-gambling"><a href="#Pennsylvania-legalizes-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania legalizes online gambling"></a>Pennsylvania legalizes online gambling</h1><p>On October 10, 2017, Pennsylvania state legislators passed a bill that legalized online gambling within the state. Governor Tom Wolf has expressed his intent to sign the bill into law, making Pennsylvania the fourth US state to offer online gambling after Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware.</p>
<p>The new law will regulate and tax both casino games and poker played over the internet. Operators must be licensed by the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board and pay a licensing fee of $10 million. The state will take a 34% tax from gross gaming revenue, with part of that money earmarked for property tax reduction and horse racing industry support.</p>
<p>Online casinos and poker rooms must meet certain requirements in order to qualify for a license. They must be physically located within Pennsylvania, offer games that are already legal in the state’s land-based casinos, and have robust anti-gambling measures in place.</p>
<p>One goal of the new law is to combat illegal offshore gambling operations. The legislation requires operators to use geolocation technology to ensure that players are physically located within Pennsylvania. Players will also be required to create an account with their true name and social security number in order to play. This should help to preventPennsylvanians from gambling on unlicensed sites operated by shady offshore operators.</p>
<p>While there are some restrictions on which games can be played online (no slot machines), most of the popular casino games will be available for play on desktop or mobile devices. Players will also have access to a wide range of betting options on sports events, including both pre-match and in-play betting.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania’s new online gambling law is good news for residents and visitors alike. It will provide more options for people who want to gamble legally, while also generating much-needed revenue for the state government.</p>
<h1 id="Rhode-Island-legalizes-online-gambling"><a href="#Rhode-Island-legalizes-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Rhode Island legalizes online gambling"></a>Rhode Island legalizes online gambling</h1><p>The state of Rhode Island has legalized online gambling, becoming the fourth state in the US to do so. The law took effect on July 1, 2019.</p>
<p>Under the new law, residents of Rhode Island will be able to gamble online through the state’s lottery system. They will also be able to bet on sports and play casino games online.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction counselors are concerned that the new law could lead to an increase in gambling addiction problems. However, supporters of the law argue that it will provide additional revenue for the state government and create jobs.</p>

        <h1 id="Minimum-age-for-casino-gambling-in-Pennsylvania-is-21"><a href="#Minimum-age-for-casino-gambling-in-Pennsylvania-is-21" class="headerlink" title="Minimum age for casino gambling in Pennsylvania is 21"></a>Minimum age for casino gambling in Pennsylvania is 21</h1><p>The minimum age for casino gambling in Pennsylvania is 21. This applies to all forms of casino gambling, including slot machines, table games, and poker.</p>
<p>The rationale for the minimum age of 21 is that it is the age at which young adults are considered to be adults in the United States. Many other activities that require adults-only participation, such as purchasing alcohol or voting, also have a minimum age of 21.</p>
<p>There are some exceptions to the minimum age requirement for casino gambling in Pennsylvania. There are three casinos in the state that are open to those 18 and older: Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course, Lady Luck Casino Nemacolin, and Parx Casino. These casinos are located on Native American reservations, and the tribes that own them are exempt from following Pennsylvania state law.</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania-casinos-have-set-the-minimum-age-to-enter-at-21"><a href="#Pennsylvania-casinos-have-set-the-minimum-age-to-enter-at-21" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania casinos have set the minimum age to enter at 21"></a>Pennsylvania casinos have set the minimum age to enter at 21</h1><p>Officials in Pennsylvania have set the minimum age to enter a casino at 21 years old. This decision was made in light of the new gambling law that was recently passed in the state. The new law allows for up to 10 casinos to be built in Pennsylvania, and those casinos will be open to those who are at least 21 years old.</p>
<p>There has been some controversy surrounding the minimum age requirement, as some people feel that it is too restrictive. They argue that it will keep many young people from being able to enjoy what the casinos have to offer. However, officials feel that this is a necessary step in order to ensure that there is responsible gambling in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>It is hoped that the minimum age requirement will help to prevent gambling addiction among young people. It will also help to ensure that those who do gamble are of legal age and are thus able to make informed decisions about their spending.</p>
<h1 id="You-must-be-at-least-21-years-old-to-gamble-in-a-PA-casino"><a href="#You-must-be-at-least-21-years-old-to-gamble-in-a-PA-casino" class="headerlink" title="You must be at least 21 years old to gamble in a PA casino"></a>You must be at least 21 years old to gamble in a PA casino</h1><p>The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) oversees all gambling in the state of Pennsylvania. The Board is tasked with ensuring the integrity and security of the gaming industry, and also with regulating casino gambling so that it is fair and safe for citizens. One of the ways the PGCB does this is by making sure that only those over 21 are allowed to gamble in a PA casino.</p>
<p>There are a few exceptions to this rule - namely, those who are 18 or older may gamble in a PA casino if they are accompanied by someone over 21. In addition, anyone under 18 is not allowed in a casino at all, regardless of accompaniment. This regulation exists to protect citizens from underage gambling, which can lead to problems such as addiction, financial instability, and crime.</p>
<p>The PGCB also regulates other forms of gambling in Pennsylvania, including horseracing, lottery games, and charitable gaming. For more information on these activities, please visit the PGCB website or contact them directly.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-entry-age-increased-to-21-in-Pennsylvania"><a href="#Casino-entry-age-increased-to-21-in-Pennsylvania" class="headerlink" title="Casino entry age increased to 21 in Pennsylvania"></a>Casino entry age increased to 21 in Pennsylvania</h1><p>On October 6, 2017, the Pennsylvania Senate passed a bill that will increase the minimum age to enter a casino from 18 to 21. The bill, which is now in the House for consideration, will also prohibit those younger than 21 from playing gambling games.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill argue that it is needed to protect minors and vulnerable populations from the dangers of gambling. Critics say that the measure will simply drive younger people to gamble illegally.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania is not the first state to increase the casino entry age. In 2013, New Jersey increased its minimum age from 18 to 21. Maine followed suit in 2016, raising its minimum age from 18 to 21.</p>
<p>The passage of this bill in Pennsylvania comes at a time when gambling is becoming increasingly popular among young people. A study by Camelot Strategic Marketing found that 54% of millennials had gambled in the past year, up from 46% in 2014.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction can have serious consequences for young people. It can lead to financial problems, ruined relationships, and even suicide.</p>
<p>If you are concerned about someone you know who may be addicted to gambling, there are resources available to help you. The National Council on Problem Gambling has a toll-free helpline at 1-800-522-4700 that can provide information and support.</p>
<h1 id="Minimum-age-to-enter-a-casino-in-PA-is-now-21"><a href="#Minimum-age-to-enter-a-casino-in-PA-is-now-21" class="headerlink" title="Minimum age to enter a casino in PA is now 21"></a>Minimum age to enter a casino in PA is now 21</h1><p>As of September 1, 2019, the minimum age to enter a casino in Pennsylvania is 21. The previously-established minimum age of 18 no longer applies.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) made the announcement on August 22, 2019. In a press release, the PGCB said that the change was made in order to “promote public safety and better protect casino patrons and employees.”</p>
<p>Pennsylvania is not the first state to raise the minimum age for casino entry; both Michigan and New Jersey have set the age at 21. Illinois is among the states considering a similar change.</p>
<p>The move by the PGCB has been met with mixed reactions. On one hand, some people argue that it will help keep minors from being exposed to gambling and other unhealthy activities in casinos. On the other hand, others worry that it will simply push underage gamblers underground, where they will be less likely to be monitored or prevented from harm.</p>
<p>Casinos in Pennsylvania brought in more than $2.3 billion in revenue last year, so it’s clear that they are a major part of the state economy. With this change in policy, it will be interesting to see how casino operators and patrons adjust – and whether or not this leads to any changes in gambling habits among Pennsylvanians.</p>
