<p>One idea being discussed is to make it illegal for family members or other close associates of casino operators or employees to gamble in the facility.</p>
<p>“But we have to be careful about how this is written, so that it covers all eventualities,” an unnamed official said.</p>
<p>Exactly how the ban would be implemented has yet to be finalized, but one possibility is that people would be required to show documentation – such as a marriage certificate – in order to prove they are not related to anyone working at the casino.</p>
<p>Others argue that such a measure would be difficult to enforce and could lead to further corruption.</p>
<p>“This is something we need to get right, as it will have a huge impact on the industry,” another government source said.</p>
<p>The draft bill proposing the casino ban is currently being considered by the cabinet and is expected to be tabled in parliament later this year.</p>
<h1 id="How-can-officials-effectively-ban-family-from-casino"><a href="#How-can-officials-effectively-ban-family-from-casino" class="headerlink" title="How can officials effectively ban family from casino?"></a>How can officials effectively ban family from casino?</h1><p>There are various ways that casino officials can ban a family from their establishment. One way is to have a sign placed at the entrance of the casino stating that families are not allowed. Another way is to verbally inform the family that they are not allowed and ask them to leave. If the family does not leave, security can be called to escort them out. Casino officials can also ban a family by having them trespass on the property. Trespassing occurs when an individual enters or remains on property without authorization from the owner or someone in control of the property. Officials may also confiscate any gaming items that are in the possession of the family.</p>
<p>There are several reasons why casinos may want to ban families from their premises. One reason may be to create a more gambling-friendly environment for adults only. Another reason may be to avoid disturbances or disruptions that families may cause. Families often have children with them and children can be noisy and disruptive. Additionally, some parents may allow their children to run around the casino which can also be disruptive. Lastly, some parents may try to use their children as an excuse to get into the casino for free or to get better deals on gaming products.</p>
<p>If a family is banned from a casino, they can file a complaint with the state gaming commission. The commission will investigate the matter and determine if the casino acted appropriately in banning the family. If it is determined that the casino acted inappropriately, then they could face penalties such as fines or suspension of their license</p>
<h1 id="Officials-deny-claims-of-a-‘clandestine’-plan-to-ban-family-from-casino"><a href="#Officials-deny-claims-of-a-‘clandestine’-plan-to-ban-family-from-casino" class="headerlink" title="Officials deny claims of a ‘clandestine’ plan to ban family from casino"></a>Officials deny claims of a ‘clandestine’ plan to ban family from casino</h1><p>The officials vehemently deny the claims of a ‘clandestine’ plan to prevent family and friends from the casino. The spokesman for the gaming authority stated that there are no plans to change the current policy and that this was only a baseless claim.</p>
<p>This comes in the wake of reports that the casino is implementing a new policy which will ban family and friends from entering the premises. The reason cited for this change is that it will help reduce crime and promote responsible gambling.</p>
<p>However, some people are not convinced by these reasons and believe that this is just a ploy by the casino to get rid of competition. They argue that family and friends are typically not a problem at casinos and that this move is only meant to benefit the casino’s bottom line.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether or not there is truth to these allegations, it is clear that this has become a contentious issue. Some people are in favour of the proposed change while others are against it. Only time will tell if the casino goes ahead with its plans or backs down in the face of public opposition</p>
<h1 id="Casino-execs-lobbying-for-exemption-for-close-relatives"><a href="#Casino-execs-lobbying-for-exemption-for-close-relatives" class="headerlink" title="Casino execs lobbying for exemption for close relatives"></a>Casino execs lobbying for exemption for close relatives</h1><p>Casino executives have been lobbying for an exemption that would allow them to give millions of dollars in campaign contributions to candidates running for office, as well as directly to political parties, without any limit. This would allow them to give the money to their close relatives, who would then be allowed to pass it along to the candidates or parties. If this exemption is not granted, the casino executives say that they may have to curtail political donations significantly.</p>
<p>The lobbying effort is being spearheaded by Las Vegas Sands Corp. Chairman and CEO Sheldon Adelson, who has already given $92 million to various political causes in the last two years. Adelson and other casino executives argue that they should be given the same treatment as other major donors, such as unions and corporations. They maintain that they are being unfairly targeted by legislators who are looking to pass new restrictions on campaign contributions.</p>
<p>Critics of the exemption say that it would create a loophole that would enable casino executives to circumvent existing donation limits. They also argue that it would give casino executives too much influence over elected officials.</p>
<p>Adelson and others involved in the lobbying effort are quick to point out that they are not asking for anything unreasonable. “All we’re asking for is a level playing field,” said Anthony Marnell III, president of Marnell Gaming LLC.</p>
<p>The campaign finance reform bill that is currently making its way through Congress includes a provision that would prohibit casino executives from making direct contributions to candidates or political parties. The provision does not apply to close relatives of the executives.</p>
<h1 id="How-the-proposed-family-ban-will-impact-casino-business"><a href="#How-the-proposed-family-ban-will-impact-casino-business" class="headerlink" title="How the proposed family ban will impact casino business"></a>How the proposed family ban will impact casino business</h1><p>The casino industry is bracing for a potential impact on their businesses if the Trump administration’s proposed family ban goes into effect. According to federal data, more than 40 million people visited casinos and other gambling establishments in the US in 2016. If the proposed ban becomes a reality, it could potentially cut that number by more than half.</p>
<p>While it’s still unclear how the proposed ban will be implemented or what it will look like, industry experts are already weighing in on the potential fallout. Some say that a ban on families would cause a casino downturn as people would be less likely to visit with their children or spouses. Others note that casino-goers may simply choose to travel to casinos outside of the US should the ban be put into place.</p>
<p>In Atlantic City, where casino business has been declining in recent years, there is particular concern about how a family ban would impact business. Stephanie Izard, vice president of marketing for Caesars Entertainment Atlantic City, notes that family visitation accounts for 50% of all visits to casinos in the city. “If this does go into effect, it’s going to hurt us bad,” she told The Press of Atlantic City.</p>
<p>Casino operators are also worried about how a potential family ban might impact employee recruitment and retention. Many casino jobs are lower- paying positions that offer little opportunity for advancement. With a family ban in place, these types of jobs may become even less appealing to potential employees. This could lead to a shortage of qualified workers and higher wages as companies compete for talent.</p>
<p>So far, there has been no announcement from the Trump administration about when or if the proposed family ban will go into effect. In the meantime, casino operators are preparing for all possible outcomes and hoping that the issue will be resolved before it causes too much damage to their businesses</p>
