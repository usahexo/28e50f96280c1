#  How Does Roulette Pay Out - Heller Play Blackjack 

In order to understand how roulette payouts work, one must first understand the different types of bets that can be made. There are inside and outside bets, with the former referring to bets placed on specific numbers or groups of numbers, and the latter referring to bets placed on the table's periphery.

With inside bets, there are a number of different payout options, with some paying out at even money (1:1), others paying out at 2:1, and still others paying out at 3:1. This is because the odds of any particular number being selected are not equal - they vary depending on how many numbers are in play. 

For instance, if there are only two numbers in play - 1 and 2 - then the odds of either one being selected are 50%. However, if there are six numbers in play - 1 through 6 - then the odds of any one number being selected is just 16.7%. 

This payout discrepancy is taken into account with inside bets, with those wagering on a longer shot receiving a higher payout than those wagering on a shorter shot. So, while a straight up bet on 1 pays out at 1:1, a straight up bet on 31 (one of the six red numbers) pays out at 6:1. 

Outside bets work differently, with all payouts being even money (1:1). This is because outside bets are not based on any specific set of numbers, but rather on whether certain conditions are met. For instance, betting on red or black will pay out at 1:1 when either color comes up, betting on odd or even will pay out at 1:1 when either option comes up, and betting on first dozen or second dozen will pay out at 2:1 when either set of twelve numbers is hit. 

Now that one understands how roulette payouts work, one can make informed decisions about where to place their money. By knowing what different payout options are available for each type of bet, as well as which ones offer the best value, one can make sure they walk away from the table a winner more often than not.
