#  Napoli Draws with Fiorentina in Derby della Mole

Rodrigo Becomes First Brazilian to Score for Fiorentina in Serie A
Rodrigo has been a revelation for La Viola this season. The Brazilian international has scored seven goals in all competitions and his latest strike came in Saturday’s 2-0 home win over Atalanta. That was his first goal in Serie A and made him the first Brazilian to score for Fiorentina in the Italian top flight.
After several near-misses, Rodrigo finally got off the mark in style by converting a penalty early in the second half. The former Benfica striker drilled home decisively from the spot after Stefan Savic had been fouled by Alejandro Gomez.
That goal helped Fiorentina to secure their fourth successive league win, keeping them fifth in the standings, just two points behind fourth-placed Lazio. Vincenzo Montella’s side are now unbeaten in their last eight games in all competitions and will be looking to continue that run when they take on Crotone at home next weekend.

Cuadrado Scores as Fiorentina Defeats Cagliari

Juan Cuadrado’s fourth-minute strike was all that separated the two sides on Sunday afternoon as Fiorentina ran out 1-0 winners over Cagliari.

The Colombian international’s early goal settled any nerves in the Viola camp and they were able to see the game out relatively comfortably, despite Mauro Icardi going close for the visitors with a curling free-kick in the second half.

Cuadrado’s goal was his first of the campaign and it will be a relief for both him and manager Vincenzo Montella, who have been coming in for criticism recently.

With this win, Fiorentina move up to eighth place in the Serie A table, just one point behind Inter Milan, who occupy the final Europa League qualification spot.

#  Falcinelli Nets Winner as Fiorentina Edges Sassuolo

The Serie A season resumed over the weekend, with a number of matchups taking place. One of the most notable results saw Fiorentina edge Sassuolo 2-1, as Leonardo Falcinelli netted the winner in stoppage time.

Both teams had chances in an exciting first half, but it was Sassuolo who took the lead shortly after the break when Jeremie Boga converted from close range. However, Fiorentina were not to be denied and equalized soon afterwards through Marco Benassi.

With the game looking like it would end in a draw, Falcinelli popped up with a late winner to give his side all three points. The win sees Fiorentina move up to fourth in the table, while Sassuolo remain in 10th.

#  ACF Fiorentina Get off to Winning Start

ACF Fiorentina beat SSC Napoli in the opening game of the Serie A TIM 2017/18 season at the San Paolo Stadium.

Jorginho had the first opportunity of the game in the 2nd minute when he shot over from outside the area after being set up by Lorenzo Insigne. 
The home side took control of the game after that, with goalkeeper Alex Meret making a couple of saves to keep them at bay. 
Insigne had a good chance to open the scoring on 27 minutes but his effort from distance went just wide of the target.

The deadlock was finally broken on 38 minutes when Jorginho’s free-kick was headed in by Jose Callejon.
Napoli could have doubled their lead before halftime but Dries Mertens’ header came back off the crossbar.

The visitors started brightly after the break and were unlucky not to level matters on 49 minutes when Davide Astori’s header came back off the post.
However, they did get themselves back into the game on 57 minutes when Giovanni Simeone scored with a great finish following good work from Federico Chiesa.
Chiesa then hit the post himself a few minutes later as Fiorentina looked for a winner. 
Meret made another save to deny substitute Nikola Kalinic in stoppage time as Napoli held on for a narrow victory.
