#  Curacao takes home $30 million from Microgaming

The island of Curacao has been enjoying a surge in its economy lately, thanks in large part to a new agreement with the gaming software giant Microgaming. Under the new arrangement, the company will be using Curacao as its primary base for all of its operations in the Latin American market.

In return, Curacao will be taking in $30 million in annual licensing fees from Microgaming. This is great news for the island, which is still recovering from a devastating hurricane last year. The influx of cash is expected to help create hundreds of new jobs on the island and revive its tourism industry.

Speaking about the agreement, Curacao's Minister for Economic Development, Dr. Steven Martina, said "We are very excited to partner with Microgaming and provide them with our world-class regulatory framework and infrastructure. This partnership is another step forward in Curacao's mission to become the Caribbean's premier igaming jurisdiction."

Microgaming's CEO, John Coleman, added "This is an important strategic move for us as we continue our growth strategy and expand into new markets. Curacao has a well-deserved reputation for being a high-quality jurisdiction with an outstanding regulator."

The agreement is also good news for players in Latin America, who will now have access to some of the best gaming products in the world. With Microgaming's experience in developing online casino games, they can look forward to playing some truly unique titles that they won't find anywhere else.

#  Curacao enjoys biggest win yet with Microgaming

The latest Curacao licensing win for Microgaming is the most significant to date, as it includes one of the most valuable trademarks in the iGaming world.

The deal encompasses all casino and gaming content from Microgaming for both desktop and mobile platforms. The operator, which has not been named, will have access to over 600 games as well as the Quickfire platform.

Commenting on the deal, CEO of Microgaming David Reynolds said: "We are absolutely delighted to have entered into this agreement with such a prestigious and successful operator. Our desktop and mobile content will provide their players with an unrivalled gaming experience."

This latest win for Microgaming comes hot on the heels of agreements with several other operators in recent months, including Videoslots.com, Trannel International and Vera&John.

Curacao is a well-respected licensing jurisdiction that is popular with operators due to its favourable tax regime. In addition, the island is known for its rigorous regulatory framework which ensures a high standard of player protection.

#  Curacao cashes in on Microgaming success

The island of Curacao is enjoying a surge in interest from online casino operators, thanks in no small part to the success of Microgaming software.

The world’s largest independent provider of casino software has made Curacao its global operations base, and the number of casinos choosing to set up shop there has multiplied as a result.

Microgaming’s vice president of business development, David Reynolds, said: “Curacao is a quality jurisdiction with an excellent regulator in the form of the Curacao Gaming Authority.

“It also offers a favourable tax regime and a large pool of well-educated and English-speaking support staff. These factors, together with our long-standing relationship with the jurisdiction, make it an attractive place for us to do business.”

Microgaming currently supplies over 600 online casinos with its software, and this number looks set to grow as more and more operators seek to take advantage of Curacao’s gambling-friendly environment.

This increased interest is also good news for the people of Curacao, who are seeing new jobs and investment being generated as a result of the Microgaming boom.

Microgaming, a Malta-based software development company, has announced a partnership with the Curacao Gaming Commission that will see the two organisations work together to create an iGaming regulatory framework.

The new framework will be aimed at both operators and players, and is expected to come into effect in the first quarter of 2019. The agreement between Microgaming and Curacao will also see the two entities co-operate on marketing and educational initiatives in order to promote responsible gaming practices.

Commenting on the partnership, Microgaming CEO John Coleman said: "We are committed to working with our partners at Curacao to create an environment that is both fair and safe for iGaming operators and players.

"Our aim is to provide a world-class experience for all involved, underpinned by responsible gaming practices. We are looking forward to launching our new content and services in Curacao in early 2019."

Curacao's Minister of Justice Cornelius de Weever also expressed his excitement about the partnership, noting that it would help position Curacao as a global leader when it comes to iGaming regulation. He added: "The government of Curacao welcomes this important step by Microgaming as it further solidifies our excellent relationship with one of the world's leading providers of casino software."
