#  How do I play blackjack at Booongo? 

First, you should choose a casino that offers blackjack games from Booongo. After registering and funding your account, you can choose to play for free or for real money. To start playing, select the game you want and click on the "Deal" button. You will then be dealt two cards face up and the dealer will be dealt two cards, one face up and one face down.

Your goal is to draw cards that add up to 21 or come as close to 21 as possible without going over. If your first two cards total 21, you have blackjack and win automatically! If the dealer has a higher total than you, he wins. If the dealer has a lower total than you, you win. If your total is the same as the dealer's, it's called a "push" and nobody wins or loses money.

You can hit (draw another card) or stand (stop drawing cards) depending on your hand. You can also double down (double your bet and receive one more card) or split (split your hand into two separate hands) if desired. The Booongo blackjack games offer many exciting features such as side bets, bonus rounds and redemption opportunities. Be sure to explore all the options available to make your gaming experience more enjoyable.
