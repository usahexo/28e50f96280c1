#  Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy Proven to be Most Effective for Treating Gambling Addiction 

According to a report recently released by the National Council on Problem Gambling, cognitive-behavioral therapy is the most effective treatment for gambling addiction. The report also found that medication and self-help groups are not as effective as CBT in helping people overcome their gambling addictions.

CBT is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on the relationship between thoughts, feelings and behaviors. CBT helps people become aware of how their thoughts and behaviors influence their emotions and vice versa. CBT can help people change the way they think and behave in order to better manage their addiction.

The National Council on Problem Gambling's report was based on a review of scientific studies on the effectiveness of different treatments for gambling addiction. The study found that CBT is more effective than other treatments in helping people overcome their addictions. CBT was found to be more effective than medication, self-help groups, and behavioral marital therapy.

The study also found that CBT is more effective than placebo in treating gambling addictions. Placebo is a dummy treatment that has no real therapeutic value. In other words, CBT is more effective than doing nothing at all in helping people overcome their gambling addictions.
