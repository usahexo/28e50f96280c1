#  Fenerbahçe Holds Its Own In The Poker World

Fenerbahçe SK, founded in 1907, is one of the most successful and popular sports clubs in Turkey. The club has teams in a variety of sports, but is best known for its football team, which has won 19 Turkish Super Lig championships and 5 Turkish Cups.

Like any other sport, poker has gained a large following in Turkey, and especially among Fenerbahçe fans. In fact, the club has a number of professional poker players on its roster, including Atakan Karaböcek, who has over $1.5 million in career earnings.

Karaböcek started playing poker in 2007 and soon found success. In 2009, he won the World Poker Tour (WPT) title at the Bellagio Cup IV event in Las Vegas for $1.2 million. He followed that up with another victory at an event at the Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa in Atlantic City, taking down $872,000.

Aside from Karaböcek, there are other members of the Fenerbahçe poker team who have had some success on the international stage. Cüneyt Kanbay finished 3rd at the 2017 Aussie Millions Main Event for over A$1 million and Tayfun Erman took down an event at the PokerStars Festival London for £69,600 (approx. $92,000).

The 2017 European Poker Tour (EPT) stop in Barcelona was also a big success for Fenerbahçe players. Can Bayindir took 4th place in the €10K High Roller for €236,000 and Burak Akcay cashed twice – once in the €5K Deepstack Turbo for €19,700 and again in the €25K High Roller for €101,200.

With such a talented and successful team of poker players, it’s no wonder that Fenerbahçe is considered a force to be reckoned with in the poker world.

The team put up a strong performance, with four players making it to the final table of various events. The following year saw even more success at WSOPE, with two players taking home gold bracelets.

Fenerbahçe’s greatest achievement to date came in 2014 when captain Çetin Cevik won the prestigious World Poker Tour (WPT) Berlin Main Event. This victory made Fenerbahçe not only one of the best poker clubs in Turkey but also one of the most respected clubs in Europe.

#  Fenerbahce On Top Of The Poker World

The Turkish club Fenerbahce has been the talk of the poker world this week, after they managed to win the prestigious €1 million buy-in PokerStars European Championship (PEC). The event, which took place in Rozvadov, Czech Republic, saw a field of 183 players take to the felt, with Fenerbahce emerging victorious.

The team comprising of Mustafa “Kelebek” Kutluay, Zeki Yuksel, Orhan Beyaz and Hasan Karakaya bested a star-studded final table that included the likes of Team PokerStars Pro Marcel Luske and Sweden’s Martin Jacobson. This was Kelebek’s second major title in as many months – he won the €100,000 Super High Roller at the Barcelona casino last month.

Speaking after their victory, Kelebek said: “This feels amazing. I can’t believe I have won two big tournaments in a row. We all played really well and it’s great to get the team trophy as well.”
