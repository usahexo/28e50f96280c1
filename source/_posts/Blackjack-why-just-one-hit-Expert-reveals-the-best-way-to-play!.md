#  Blackjack why just one hit? Expert reveals the best way to play!

Countering the dealer’s up-card with a hit is one of the worst decisions you can make in blackjack, says seasoned pro.

“A lot of people just hit blindly because they see that the dealer has a good card,” commented blackjack expert James Grosjean. “But that’s actually not the best move – especially if your hand is strong.”

Grosjean recommends doubling down instead – especially when you have an 11 or 12.

“If the dealer is showing a 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, then you should definitely double down,” he advised. “You have a decent chance of getting closer to 21 this way, and you also won’t risk losing as much money if the dealer manages to pull ahead.”

Grosjean also said that standing on 17 is usually a good move – unless the dealer is showing an Ace. In that case, he recommends hitting unless you have an 18 or higher.

So next time you hit the casino floor, make sure to remember these tips from Grosjean – and maybe you can walk away with more chips than when you arrived!

#  Could blackjack be rigged? One player thinks so after losing big!

A blackjack player is claiming that the game may be rigged, after losing a large amount of money.

The player, who asked to remain anonymous, said that he had been playing at a casino in downtown Las Vegas when he started to notice some strange happenings. He began to lose systematically, and no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t seem to win.

Suspecting that something was wrong, the player requested a copy of the security footage from the casino. When he watched it back, he was shocked to see that the dealer appeared to be helping certain players and making it harder for him to win.

He has since filed a complaint with the Nevada Gaming Commission and is calling for an investigation into the casino’s practices.

So is blackjack rigged? While it’s certainly possible, there’s no concrete evidence that this is actually happening at casinos around the world. If you do suspect that something fishy is going on, it’s best to speak to customer support or management and see if they can help clear things up.

#  How to win at blackjack: The secret revealed!

Are you looking for ways to improve your blackjack game? Do you feel like you could be doing better if you only knew some insider tips? Look no further – we’re going to reveal the secret to winning at blackjack right here!

1. Learn the basic rules of the game

The first step to becoming a blackjack master is to learn the basics of the game. Blackjack is a relatively simple game, but there are a few basic rules that you need to know in order to play correctly. Once you have mastered the rules, move on to learning some more advanced techniques.

2. Practice, practice, practice!

Like any other skill, playing blackjack requires practice in order to improve. The more you play, the better you will become at making smart decisions and winning money. So hit up your local casino or online casino and start playing today!

3. Know when to hit and when to stand

One of the most important skills you need to develop as a blackjack player is knowing when to hit and when to stand. If you hit too often, you may end up busting (going over 21). If you stand too often, you may lose out on potential wins. It takes time and experience to figure out the right setting for each hand, but it’s worth it once you start winning more consistently.

4. Use basic strategy charts

Once you have a good understanding of when to hit and when to stand, it’s time to start using basic strategy charts. These charts will give you the optimal decision for every possible situation at the blackjack table. There are many different charts available online, so be sure to choose one that fits your playing style.

5. Understand how cards are valued

In blackjack, cards are valued as follows: 2 through 10 are worth their face value, an ace can be worth 1 or 11, and all other cards are worth zero points. This knowledge is essential in making sound decisions while playing the game. For example, if you have an Ace and a 6 (totaling 17), you should always stand because hitting would likely result in a bust.

#  The one mistake you don't want to make when playing blackjack

When playing blackjack, there are a few key things you need to remember in order to give yourself the best chance of winning. Of course, luck also plays a part, but if you make the following mistake, you're likely to end up losing money.

The mistake we're talking about is splitting your cards. When you're dealt two cards of the same value, it can be tempting to split them and try and make two hands out of them. However, this is usually not a good idea, as you'll usually end up with worse hands than if you had just stuck with one.

There are a few exceptions to this rule - for example, if you have two aces, splitting them is usually a good idea. But for the most part, it's best to just stick with one card. This will give you a better chance of winning the hand and avoiding big losses.

#  Why hitting on 17 can be a bad move - even if the dealer is showing a 6

When it comes to playing blackjack, most players know that the general rule of thumb is to hit on any hand totaling 17 or less, and stand on any hand totaling 18 or more. But what many players may not know is that there are some exceptions to this rule - and one of those exceptions is when the dealer is showing a 6.

In this scenario, even though it may be tempting to hit on 17 instead of standing, it's actually a bad move to do so. That's because the dealer has a high chance of busting with a 6, and if they do, you'll end up losing your bet even if you would have otherwise won the hand.

It's important to remember that blackjack is a game of odds, and in most cases, it's better to play it safe than take unnecessary risks. So if the dealer is showing a 6, always stand on 17 - no matter how tempting it may be to hit.
